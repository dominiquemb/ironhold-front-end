            versus JAMA CY13e of 4.74m. Mini sales 2m and non-mini at 3.3m were 11%
            and 12% above JAMA’s CY13 projections. While it is early days for the FY, the
            run rate suggests upside to Toyota forecasts and that there actually might be
            enough mini car demand to meet various aggressive forecasts. What isn’t clear
            is if this is a positive impact from “Abeconmics” or if it is consumers acting
            ahead of consumption tax hikes from next year.

            Pretty strong day for mex rates. 10yr TIIE traded as high as 6.11% but after the US data, it rallied and
            closed near the lows of the session. If the MXN can also rally a bit, then I think the rally in mex rates
            can continue back to the 5.75%-5.80% area in the 10yr.

            Venz the underperformer today as a weak GDP print and Merentes

            risk at the end of the day, both in the HY names and the CDX.
            LATAM IG traded firm, as we seem to have found a clearing level

            RATES

            The Chilean price action today was really ugly. At the beginning, the market was receiver after the BCCh
            minutes. The first trade in the premarket was 2Y CLPxCAM at 4.58% (-12bp) but at this level the flows from
            client were in the take profit side (of receiver) more than in the receiver side because the curve had 75bp
            cut and this is too aggressive in the current scenario. In the aftermarket, we saw some dealers looking for
            offer in 1y and 2Y CLPxCAM at the closing levels.

            The long end of the CLPXCAM curve was bid all the day. 10Y CLP traded at 5.30% and the closing was 5.34% in
            this tenor. The rationality is cuts in the MPR will be just in short terms because at the current level of
            FX the inflation could be a problem in medium terms. In this regard, the movement of the B/E inflation in
            the long end was aggressive too to the RHS.

            In the bond side, we saw the same situation. The market was buying bonds in the front end but in the long
            end the movement was smaller.

            An interesting day for sure. Both Venz and PDVSA curves were down 1.50 to 2pts
            today on extremely low volumes. There were some sellers around, but not big
            size. Felt more like some shorts used the selling to pressure the curve and no
            one is brave enough yet to fight it from the long side. There was a bit of a
            bounce of the lows at the end of the day, but no big buyers coming in just yet.

            Quiet day overall with better buying in mbonos after weak US data. Model accounts turned to payers in the
            belly of the curve and that helped the 5x10 TIIE spread flatten 4bps intraday (closed 2bps flatter). Macro
            names are dipping their toes back in the water again at these levels. I&apos;ll be playing it as flat as
            possible until Friday&apos;s numbers.
            Good Luck.

            1) Senators Near Plan to Abolish Fannie Mae, Shrink Government Role
            (Bloomberg) -- A bipartisan group of U.S. senators are putting the final touches on a plan to liquidate
            Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and replace them with a government reinsurer of mortgage securities behind
            private capital. The proposed legislation, which could be introduced this month, would require private
            financiers to take a first-loss position adequate to cover price declines as steep as those seen during
            recessions over the past century, according to a draft ...

            2) Frank Lautenberg, U.S. Senator From New Jersey, Dies at 89
            (Bloomberg) -- Frank Lautenberg, the millionaire businessman turned U.S. senator who wrote laws that raised
            the legal drinking age to 21 and banned smoking on domestic airplane flights, has died. The five-term
            Democrat from New Jersey was 89. He died today at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical
            Center, according to a statement from his office. The cause was complications from viral pneumonia. ...

            3) Lautenberg Vacancy Pick Is Election-Year Challenge for Christie
            (Bloomberg) -- The death of New Jersey Democratic Senator Frank Lautenberg has thrust a politically
            challenging set of decisions before Chris Christie, the state’s Republican governor. He must choose an
            interim replacement for Lautenberg and set a special-election date for a permanent one, all in a year when
            Christie is seeking re-election in a state that backed President Barack Obama’s re-election by 17 percentage
            points. New Jersey’s partisan bent ...

            4) Vegetarians Live Longer as Men Get Best Results, Researchers Say
            (Bloomberg) -- A vegetarian diet may help people, particularly men, live longer than those who regularly eat
            meat, according to a study of more than 70,000 Seventh-Day Adventists. Researchers followed the participants
            an average of 6 years. During that period, vegetarians, including those who also added seafood or dairy and
            egg products to their diet, had an average 12 percent lower chance of dying from any cause than meat-eaters,
            according to the findings published ...

            5) Janzen Disqualified From U.S. Open Qualifying for Metal Spikes
            (Bloomberg) -- Two-time U.S. Open champion Lee Janzen was ejected from a sectional qualifying event today in
            Rockville, Maryland, for wearing metal spikes on his golf shoes. Janzen shot 75 during the first of two
            rounds at Woodmont Country Club before being notified that he violated a local club rule barring metal
            cleats. Janzen is one of more than 800 golfers competing today in 11 sectional events for 57 spots in next
            week’s U.S. Open championship at Merion ...

            Overview

            The market is looking for answers in the data but only seems to get more questions. Hopes for a usd rally in
            Asia faded quickly with better Chinese data was followed by decent European PMIs which caused usd weakness
            into the NY session. Still the usd rebounded in early trading as it seemed a reasonable thesis that if
            global PMIs were broadly stronger than that should surely translate to a impressive ISM. However ISM was 49
            and the usd bulls detailed in IMM report on Friday, decided to sell first and ask questions later. Usdjpy
            cracked through 100 to 98.86 and usdcad broke down to 1.0261. Interestingly Treasuries soared but faltered
            and ended flat on the day. Equities were confused about whether this was good or bad news and wobbled at
            times before closing modestly higher on the day. Fed Lockhart perhaps downplayed the ISM by suggesting that
            the Fed could still taper this summer but he thought inflation pressures were low. So the G10 currency
            market took the brunt of the pain. EM currencies rallied with EM equities gaining but EM bonds still
            struggling. Manufacturing has been a fairly consistent weak link but the economic data will turn back
            towards confidence and non manufacturing ISM which should be more encouraging.

            The day

            Our Japanese equity positioning note suggested more pain and Nikkei (-3.7%) continued to damage overall pain
            threshold. Aud was a big figure higher than Friday after China data and some hope surrounding Chinese demand
            of base metals. DB&apos;s Harvey noted Eurozone final PMIs were much stronger in May. Italy&apos;s final
            manufacturing PMI was 47.3 from 46.2 preliminary and up from 45.5 the previous month. France&apos;s final
            manufacturing PMI was 46.4 versus 45.5 preliminary and up from the same level the previous month. Germany&apos;s
            final manufacturing PMI was 49.4 versus 49 preliminary and up from 49 the previous month. This took the
            composite PMI 48.3 from 47.8 preliminary. Saravelos said this suggested the last two weeks of May were
            stronger than the first two and in line with gradual improvement from Q4.

            UK May manufacturing PMI was much stronger and Sweden, Norway, Poland and South Africa showed hope in May
            PMI readings. The Markit PMI added little but Canadian PMI at 53 continued the trend. The usd rallied but
            usdjpy was still languishing on just over 100. When ISM printed at 49, it lead to a broad wave of usd
            selling as Treasuries soared and equities rallied and then faltered. Lavorgna noted the ISM now at its
            lowest level since June 2009 (45.8), which was the last month of the previous recession. The weakness was
            broad based as production (48.6 vs. 53.5), new orders (48.8 vs. 52.3) and supplier deliveries (48.7 vs.
            50.9) all fell. Inventories rose (49.0 vs. 46.5), which is a mild negative because it occurred against the
            backdrop of softer production and order flow. Employment was essentially unchanged (50.1 vs. 50.2), so no
            reason to alter our May payroll forecast of +125k compared to the consensus of +167k.

            We took some hope as Ruskin noted the ISM said hopefully this was a momentary lull. &quot;The past
            relationship between the PMI(tm) and the overall economy indicates that the average PMI(tm) for Jan through
            May (51.7 pct) corresponds to a 3 percent increase in real gross domestic product (GDP) on an annualized
            basis. In addition, if PMI(tm) for May (49 pct) is annualized, it corresponds to a 2.1 pct increase in real
            GDP annually.&quot; Fed funds moved down almost 5 bps for early 2016, equities were not impressed, perhaps
            everyone has had enough of QE carry game.. Perhaps there are no shorts to squeeze in equities... There was a
            typo in the sell in May.. it was sell bonds and go away..

            Mexico ISM also fell to 49 but the usd fell sharply again zar and usdmxn moved modestly lower.
            Fed Lockhart suggested the Fed is approaching the time at which it may taper but &quot;we have to be
            cautious, to make sure that we&apos;re reading an economy that has momentum and has growing confidence.&quot;
            He adds that &quot;there&apos;s certainly a case for, at this very moment, it being a little bit premature.
            So, you know I think it&apos;s a meeting-by-meeting kind of thing
            The IMF cut it German GDP forecast in half and we trimmed our view as well . US yields started to edge back
            higher and we added back some fed tightening as usdjpy rallied back, slowly at first on more talk of longer
            dated BOJ liquidity operations and a repeat of Japan&apos;s government is set to urge the nation&apos;s
            public pension funds to invest offshore.

            The weakness in US manufacturing was in contrast to auto sale as Ford and Chrysler reported solid sales
            gains on surging demand for F-Series and Ram pickups pace the industry&apos;s best year since 2007. &quot;New
            home construction remains really the driving force behind growth in the pickup truck market, not to mention
            the fact that the energy markets have been booming The annualized industry sales rate, adjusted for seasonal
            trends, rose to 15.3 million

            The usd saw heavy positioning reduction but the usd did edge off the lows Equities rallied back steadily
            after basing late morning and usd bulls seemed to have enough for now.

            Other points

            EM bonds struggled again. Someone noted 20 pct of all US bond ETFs in the intermediate/long end are
            leveraged!!

            Conclusion

            When you look over the last few years when aud based around 95 cents, the rally from the lows was explosive
            and somewhat like the 2 pct rally we saw today which is unsettling for bears. Yet the usd index remains
            still in the up channel and has a 38 pct retracement at 82.20/40. We noted the history of weak ISM reports
            in May and better data in the days ahead might boost that view to discount the May report. Still the
            question is growing whether even strong US data can deliver a sustainable higher usd. In 1994, the usd
            weakened with the bond market and we need to have more confidence that the US bond market can be supported.
            The S&amp;P correction is 3.8 pct so far which is decent given the Nikkei is flirting with bear market
            status. Usdjpy should find some willing selling into 99.80 overnight risking 100.10.

            The usd bull community feels pretty shaken and down some performance. Well, at least, that is how I am
            feeling..

            David Geisker 5.35 p.m eur at 1.3078 jpy at 99.46 equities up 0.59 pct, 10 year 2.12 pct

            EM assets have sold off sharply in the last two weeks, across FX, local debt and hard currency debt (EM
            equity has been less affected). There is little doubt that the spike in US yields (driven by ‘tapering’
            concerns) has played a key role. In addition, disappointment about global fixed income buying from Japan has
            been an additional factor. Broadly speaking, however, the moves have been more flow driven, than tied to
            fundamental macro forces. Specifically, there has been little domestic EM news that justify the specific
            moves that we have seen. As such, we don’t expect the recent EM sell-off to turn into a trending move lower,
            although flow factors could remain head-winds for some time to come. That said, there are EM growth risks on
            the horizon (but ironically they should be more problematic for equity than for fixed income). At the same
            time, together this may mean that long opportunities in EM FX are going to be more tactical in nature than
            has generally been the case in previous years.

            The bottom line is that think it is a little early to fade the EM sell-off on a broad basis in FX and fixed
            income space. But we are adding a clip of long EURCHF (around 1.2450), which has been dragged lower (due to
            a funding squeeze effect and weaker ISM). We prefer adding the EURCHF initially, since the downside is much
            more well-defined in that cross relative to $/EM.

            Below, some additional analysis, including a heat-map of EM asset moves, highlighting the largest volatility
            adjusted moves globally. This is not a normal ‘risk aversion’ driven sell-off. The composition is very much
            different from previous EM sell-offs from the last few years. Well, everything is pretty different in 2013
            really.

            Good luck!

            [NOMURA]


            Global FX Insights: The EM sell-off: Taking Stock


            Global investors have had plenty to worry about in the past two to three weeks. The Japanese stock market
            has taken a severe beating. The US bond market seen one of its sharpest sell-offs in recent years. And EM
            assets, both bonds and FX, have sold off sharply, especially last week.

            What is driving this? When will it end? Are these moves temporary or is it just the beginning of something
            more permanent?

            There is little doubt that the sell-off in the US bond market, linked to uncertainty about when the Fed will
            start to scale back monetary easing, has been a key catalyst. And since we are right at the threshold for
            where convexity hedging may become sizeable, we cannot rule out further upside pressure on 10yr yields (see
            ‘Agency MBS Special Topics: Convexity Hedging Flows?&lt;http://go.nomuranow.com/research/globalresearchportal/getpub.aspx?pid=615675&amp;appname=GRP&amp;cid=MkppaDAwWjRLaVk90&gt;‘).

            In Japan, there has been no major fresh news on the policy front or on economic data. The Nikkei had gained
            46% from January 1 to its peak on May 22. And it is now down about 14% from the peak. Clearly, positioning
            is playing a role. The other factor is volatility in the JGB market, which is making domestic institutional
            investors nervous. The implication is that the much-anticipated wall of Kuroda-money, which was expected to
            flood various global fixed income markets, has been much weaker than expected and not consistent from week
            to week. For example, Japanese investors sold foreign bonds in the week of May 19 for the second week in a
            row. The selling accelerated to JPY1117bn (USD11.0bn) from JPY801bn the previous week.

            In EM countries, there has been disappointing growth news in China and Brazil, and a few other countries.
            This is a trend we have been talking about for a while. But there has been nothing very significant in
            recent weeks. In addition, the EM sell-off has been much more fixed-income-focused than equity-focused,
            which does not match up well with the nature of the EM-related news (weaker growth and generally benign
            inflation). Meanwhile, correlations between EM bonds and FX have shifted to high levels; a sign of
            indiscriminate position liquidation (Figure 1).

            The logical conclusion is that the sell-off has been catalyzed by the adjustment higher in global benchmark
            rates (particularly US rates) and disappointment about Japanese flows. But the specific nature and
            composition of the move has a lot to do with positioning and technical considerations, rather than macro
            factors.

            A heatmap of EM asset moves

            Last week saw outsized moves in a number of EM assets from the South African rand to Mexican rates.

            The tables below show the moves across 17 EM countries in terms of percentages for equity and FX moves and
            in bp for fixed income moves. We show the moves over the last two weeks in volatility-adjusted terms, to
            make them all comparable.

            We use swap rates instead of bond yields to get constant maturities, and note that rate moves have generally
            been similar in bond and swap markets, though ASWs have moved as well to some degree.

            [[image]]


            Source: Nomura, Bloomberg. Note: PLN, HUF and CZK are quoted vs. EUR, and RUB is the basket


            What is remarkable is that some of the most popular assets have had large vol-adjusted moves, with Mexico
            and Turkey as key examples, especially in a two-week window. It is also notable that hard currency bonds
            have sold off, significantly so in spread-to-UST terms as well, especially for Mexico and Philippines.

            There is some correlation between which markets have recently attracted the largest flows, and which have
            seen the largest moves. Mexico is again an example of this.

            A reverse example of this is those economies that have not been in the limelight. For example, as our EMEA
            strategists have pointed out, the Romanian 10yr bond has barely moved in this sell-off.

            When is enough?

            Emerging markets is such a broad construct that it typically does not make sense to talk about EM assets in
            very broad terms. However, in this sell-off, there has been a high degree of synchronization between FX,
            local debt and even hard currency debt (again suggesting that flow factors are at play). For example, it is
            notable that the 30-day rolling correlation between EM bonds and EM FX is at a very high level (see Figure 1
            on page 1).

            local bonds use the Markit iBoxx Global Emerging Markets Local Currency Bond Index, and hard currency uses
            the Citigroup ESBI


            Fig. 6: Rates still historically low, even after recent sell-off


            [[image]]


            Source: Nomura, Bloomberg


            Equity is a separate matter, as there was actually a bear-market going on through most of 2013, and the
            sell-off has so far been mild in volatility-adjusted terms (Figures 4 and 5 illustrate this).

            We think quite possible that FX, local and hard currency debt continue to trade together in the very near
            term. Although, it could be the case that FX turns before fixed income, because it is being used as hedging
            tool (while bond positions are harder to exit).

            Since, this EM sell-off is not about domestic catalysts, it is probably not going to matter much what
            domestic economic data do, although it may matter how central banks respond to FX weakness, if at all. From
            this perspective, any trading views are likely to be country-specific (for details on region and
            country-specific views see ‘EM Special Report: Potential effects on EMFX following a withdrawal of Fed
            stimulus&lt;http://go.nomuranow.com/research/globalresearchportal/getpub.aspx?pid=616082&amp;appname=GRP&amp;cid=MkppaDAwWjRLaVk90&gt;’)

            The flow picture and the trend in US rates markets are likely to be key in the next few weeks.
            High-frequency fund flow data showed that EM bond flow turned slightly negative last week (-$0.2bn), for the
            first time since July (during which period we have seen a total inflow of $49bn, with more than half of that
            going to local bond funds). EM equity flows have been slow for a while, but last week saw the largest
            outflow since December 2011 for EM equity funds (-$2.9bn). The fact that these flows are turning in response
            to the volatility is a sign that this unwind could continue in the near term.

            Another challenge here is that we have come so far in the first place in terms of positions of EM curves.
            Hence, even after the recent spike, yields look historically low (Figure 6). In a non-QE world (if we do
            indeed see that sometime soon), if term premia were to snap higher once again, we think long-end rates in EM
            could stay permanently higher in some countries.

            Things to watch and strategy

            In this context, it is not clear to us that the EM sell-off is done. Many will be waiting for important US
            data this week before taking a clearer stand on the direction of global rates for example (especially
            Friday’s NFP). This is especially true as we see a risk of convexity-fueled selling in the coming days,
            which could imply another leg higher in US interest rates. Therefore, we detail some metrics that we will be
            watching over the next few days/weeks to ascertain good entry points into some of our fundamental views.

            1. Reduction in correlation between EM fixed income and FX markets would be a welcome sign that panic
            selling pressure has abated somewhat.

            2. Whether EM funds face redemption: We have seen early signs of this trend for bonds, though EM local bond
            funds still saw inflows last week. We will be tracking these closely.

            3. Divergence between $/G10 and $/EM: Given growth differentials, and policy expectations, we expect USD to
            rally more against low-yielding DM currencies than EM. A return to this trend would be a welcome sign of
            normalcy, especially as we expect FX to normalize before bonds.

            Finally, we want to highlight a few FX opportunities, which may be opening up, and we will look to trade
            once the panic is over.

            First, EURCHF has been pushed lower by a squeeze on EM currencies (and their funding). In the absence of
            this funding squeeze, EURCHF would have likely broken well above 1.25 (in the face of upward pressure on
            USDCHF). With markets having calmed somewhat this morning, we are adding the first leg of the long EURCHF
            trade ($10mn), at 1.248 with a stop-loss at 1.23.

            Within EM, our preferred currency from a long-term perspective remains MXN. We have now given back all gains
            from 2013. Our end-year forecast of 11.90 still looks achievable to us. We are inclined to get involved in
            FX before bonds, and currently hold a 12.10 put which was knocked in at 12.36 (see ‘First Insights: USDMXN
            Put Knocked-in&lt;http://go.nomuranow.com/research/globalresearchportal/getpub.aspx?pid=614530&amp;appname=GRP&amp;cid=MkppaDAwWjRLaVk90&gt;’)
            but will look to add to this position as we get evidence that the EM washout has run its course.

            While there may be tactical long EM FX opportunities developing, we note that we closed our strategic long
            EM position last week (see ‘G10 FX Insights: What now? After Bernanke and the Nikkei crash&lt;http://go.nomuranow.com/research/globalresearchportal/getpub.aspx?pid=615511&amp;appname=GRP&amp;cid=MkppaDAwWjRLaVk90&gt;‘),
            and look to trade EM tactically/ opportunistically over the coming weeks.

            Valuation methodology - Fixed Income

            Nomura’s Fixed Income Strategists express views on the price of securities and financial markets by
            providing trade recommendations. These can be relative value recommendations, directional trade
            recommendations, asset allocation recommendations, or a mixture of all three.

            The analysis which is embedded in a trade recommendation would include, but not be limited to:

            • Fundamental analysis regarding whether a security’s price deviates from its underlying macro- or
            micro-economic fundamentals.

            • Quantitative analysis of price variations.

            • Technical factors such as regulatory changes, changes to risk appetite in the market, unexpected rating
            actions, primary market activity and supply/ demand considerations.

            The timeframe for a trade recommendation is variable. Tactical ideas have a short timeframe, typically less
            than three months. Strategic trade ideas have a longer timeframe of typically more than three months.

            FX Alpha | Trading the RBS Currency Ranker: Short USD/THB
            Foreign Exchange | FX Alpha
            3 Jun 2013
            * A new month, a new trade from the RBS Currency Ranker. Last month the model recommended short NZD/PHP
            which made 4.3%. This month the model signals short USD/THB.
            * As a reminder, the Currency Ranker gives a score of between (1) and (5) to 31 currencies globally for 17
            different drivers. It then uses the results for those 17 drivers to produce a composite score for each
            currency. The model then searches for discrepancies between currencies&apos; monthly change and their
            ranking score. Specifically, the weights on each factor are optimised to best fit FX performance over a
            month. The model then systematically searches for the two currencies with the largest difference in
            performance and the smallest divergence in its fitted ranking. The Currency Ranker is therefore mean
            reversion driven by medium term fundamentals.
            * Each monthly trade must comprise one currency which has depreciated vs. USD and one which has appreciated
            over the month to increase the chance of mean reversion (for the USD we measure performance via the DXY
            index). In May, the model recommended short NZD/PHP which made 4.3%. For June, the model recommends short
            USD/THB. This is the trade which combines the largest discrepancy in monthly FX performance in May and the
            smallest divergence in ranking.

            * The RBS Currency Ranker fills the gap in our valuation infrastructure, sitting in between our short-term
            rich/cheap models and much longer term FX drivers.

            * Since the Currency Ranker went live in January 2013 it has had five profitable months (see table below).

            Abe to urge review of Japan&apos;s public fund strategy -sources
        </Subject>
        <MsgBody>
            From our stratgy desk: GPIF story is likely to be included Abe&apos;s speech on Wednesday, according to
            Nikkei. However, the time schedule is not impressive based on the article. Build a special committee in June
            under the cabinet and the committee will make a proposal this autumn. The committee is expected to discuss
            to raise equity share and to allow the fund to include REITs, commodity, PE investment and so on. In
            addition, GPIF is likely to hire more professionals to change its investment style. Changes will take for
            1-2 years, according to the article. At the same time, the discussion is not only for GPIF but also other
            funds under the government. Total AUM is about JPY200trn, so the impact can be significant in the medium
            term.

            Below is an article from Reuters.

            06:22 04Jun13 RTRS-RPT-EXCLUSIVE-Abe to urge review of Japan&apos;s public fund strategy -sources

            TOKYO, June 4 (Reuters) - Japan&apos;s government is set to urge the nation&apos;s public pension funds - a
            pool of over $2 trillion - to increase their investment in equities and overseas assets as part of a growth
            strategy being readied by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, according to people with knowledge of the policy shift.
            The steps, which could be announced as soon as Wednesday, represent the first time the Abe administration
            has looked to mobilize Japan&apos;s massive pool of savings to support a growth agenda that aims to spur
            more consumer spending and corporate investment by pushing the economy toward 2 percent inflation.
            It also suggests a new element of risk to the policies known as Abenomics since it would shift funding from
            the government to the private sector at the risk of driving interest rates higher.
            Specifically, the government will set up a panel in July to consider the investment strategies of public
            funds, which, like other Japanese institutional investors, have relied heavily on investment in Japanese
            government bonds in recent years.
            The panel review will be included as part of a package of steps intended to boost growth set to be announced
            on Wednesday, according to the people with knowledge of the preparations who asked not to be named because
            an announcement has not been made.
            The panel will look to reach a conclusion as soon as this autumn on strategy and will urge implementation of
            the new investment guidelines by public funds no later than April 2015, according to the sources.
            As part of its deliberations, the panel will consider steps to allow the public funds to invest in
            alternative investments, including infrastructure financing both in Japan and abroad, the sources said.
            The more aggressive investment strategy would apply to the Government Pension Investment Fund, known as
            GPIF, and about 100 other semi-governmental funds and public funds such as Federation of National Public
            Service Personnel Mutual Aid Associations, known as KKR.
            In recent years, Japanese public funds led by GPIF have followed a conservative strategy that has meant a
            large allocation of funds to the Japanese government bond market and made them a near-captive source of
            financing for government spending.
            GPIF, for instance, manages a portfolio that includes a mid-point target of a 67-percent allocation for
            domestic bonds, 11 percent for domestic stocks, 9 percent for foreign stocks and 8 percent for foreign
            bonds.

            GPIF IN FOCUS
            Abe has unleashed fiscal and monetary stimulus to boost growth in the short-term. But at the same time,
            officials have taken steps to reassure investors that Japan will tackle a public debt that is the biggest in
            the developed world at more than twice the size of the nation&apos;s annual economic output.
            A government advisory panel warned last month that there was &quot;no guarantee&quot; that domestic
            investors would keep financing the nation&apos;s massive public debt, saying such a move could drive
            interest rates higher and crimp long-term growth prospects.
            Reuters reported last week that GPIF has already been considering change to its portfolio strategy that
            could allow its investment in domestic stocks to grow with a rallying market. The fund manages the national
            pension and pension insurance for the private sector.
            The Reuters report sent both the dollar higher against the yen and Nikkei futures higher as investors
            reacted to the prospect that the world&apos;s largest public pension fund could increase its exposure to
            assets other than domestic bonds.
            The new government panel will review the investment strategies of public funds more generally, including
            steps to diversify portfolios and to establish a structure to improve risk management.
            Japan&apos;s Health Ministry currently supervises the investment strategies of public pension funds.
            GPIF&apos;s investment model went unchanged through the global financial crisis of 2008 and served the fund
            well through the years of slow growth in Japan since.
            But more recently, the public pension&apos;s allocations have been bumping up against the established limits
            under its conservative portfolio.
            By end-December, the public fund was about 60 percent invested in domestic bonds, approaching the minimum 59
            percent limit. It had about 13 percent in foreign equities, close to its allocation ceiling of 14 percent.
            The main idea under consideration would be for GPIF to change the way it evaluates the potential risk and
            return on assets to allow it more flexibility, sources have said.
            Although Tokyo markets have turned volatile, stocks have rallied since Abe began pushing his policies ahead
            of his December election victory. At the same time, the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond has
            risen to near 1 percent, ending a rally in the government debt market that began in 2006.
            More recently, stocks have fallen back from their highs and yields have retreated on the benchmark 10-year
            bond.
            The Nikkei fell 3.7 percent to a six-week low on Monday and the 10-year yield slipped to 0.805 percent.

            Venny Market: difficult day for many, there were strong sellers of VENZ-31, VENZ27 and PDV17n. Rumors about
            of a new devaluation may have triggered the sell-off. We do not expect it to happen yet.

            Argy Market: quiet and stable, Boden15 gained 2cents, PAR$ lost 3cents to 34.5. Dollar blue is at ARS 8.60
            with low demand unlike to Call Money that jumped to 15% from 10.40%.

            Domrep Market: quiet and stable, Domrep-21 context 112.2-113.2. Hector Valdez Albizu, Governor of the CBRD,
            said that institution releases DOP4Bn p/week to reactivate the credits, it is a great news for the economy.

            Rise in potential growth and its implications
            Economics | Japan Economics Weekly
            3 Jun 2013
            The outline of the Abe administration&apos;s growth strategy has emerged in the last week. The government is
            placing emphasis on corporate-friendly policies, in contrast to household-friendly ones under the DPJ
            administration, and we expect a boost to the longer-term growth rate and productivity if these policies are
            fully implemented. We see a substantial lift in potential growth if efforts during the concentrated
            investment promotion period over the next three years stimulate domestic capital investment as envisioned by
            the Abe administration. This, in turn, could alter investor assessment of interest rates and other financial
            market trends. If the initiatives are capable of boosting economic growth, stock prices (which have
            primarily risen on expectations, and the large upswing in long-term interest rates in May) could rise from
            heightened inflation expectations and rising optimism on macro fundamentals. We analyse this qualitative
            assessment by focusing on the extent to which implementing growth strategies could actually boost Japan&apos;s
            potential growth.

            Topic: Rise in potential growth and its implications
            The outline of the Abe administration&apos;s growth strategy has emerged in the last week. The government is
            placing emphasis on corporate-friendly policies, in contrast to the household-friendly ones of the DPJ
            administration, and we expect a boost to the longer-term growth rate and productivity if these policies are
            fully implemented. We see a substantial lift in potential growth if efforts during the concentrated
            investment promotion period over the next three years stimulate domestic capital investment as envisioned by
            the Abe administration. This in turn could alter investor assessment of interest rates and other financial
            market trends. If the growth initiatives win investor trust that they are capable of strengthening economic
            growth, we see a possibility of stock prices (which have primarily risen on expectations, and the large
            upswing in long-term interest rates in May) receiving support not only from heightened inflation
            expectations but also rising optimism on macro fundamentals. We analyse this qualitative assessment by
            focusing on the extent to which implementing growth strategies could actually boost Japan&apos;s potential
            growth.

            Growth strategy focus
            The Abe administration&apos;s growth strategy consist of the following three components - 1) industrial
            revitalisation; 2) strategic market creation; and 3) global initiatives.

            These components are not just qualitative expressions and present many numerical goals aimed at raising
            economic growth potential. The plan has specific goals, in contrast to past growth strategies, such as a 10%
            increase in capital investments over three years and a 5ppt rise in the employment rate for population in
            the 20-64 age group by 2020 under the first component; a 40% reduction in production costs for major
            agricultural products under the second; and raising the FTA ratio of total trade value from 19% now to 70%
            in 2018 under the third.

            For these growth strategies to be effective, it is important that they raise the economy&apos;s potential
            growth rate over an extended span of 3-5 years, in contrast to past stopgap emergency economic measures
            implemented that just delivered a lift to the near-term growth rate. If these substantive growth strategies
            provide a full-fledged boost to Japan&apos;s potential growth rate, we also expect a major change in the
            view of interest rates that incorporate this factor. The interest rate is typically expressed in the
            following manner from the standpoint of economic fundamentals.

            Interest rate = Potential growth rate + anticipated inflation rate = risk premium

            We think the large upswing by the 10yr interest rate in May might be evaluated in hindsight as a fair level
            correction that reflected not only a higher anticipated inflation rate following the BoJ&apos;s
            new-dimension easing but also a rise in potential growth.

            While the latest growth strategies have a broad scope as indicated above, we think the 10% capital
            investment increase and employment expansion items under industrial revitalization deserve attention for
            their ability to directly affect potential growth. If realized over the longer term, these items would raise
            capital and labour input that make up the potential growth rate and also strengthen potential growth
            indirectly by raising productivity.

            We begin by confirming the past potential growth rate before a discussion of how these growth items might
            raise potential growth. In Figure 3, we present the potential growth rate using the potential trend
            extracted from actual labour and capital input volumes, based on the production function approach, plus
            total factor productivity (TFP) estimated separately.

            It is necessary to view potential growth forecasts using a range, due to differences among forecasters
            regarding items included as input factors, whether average concepts are applied to trend item extraction and
            production factors, and other points. We think the overall trend of a substantial drop in the potential
            growth rate after the collapse of Japan&apos;s bubble economy, followed by a temporary recovery phase in the
            mid-2000s, but then a further dip to an all-time low around the Lehman Shock is generally accurate. We
            estimate that Japan&apos;s recent potential growth rate is 0.48%, and the BoJ uses the expression &quot;around
            0.5%.&quot;

            Looking back at past composition, the negative contribution of labour input at almost all times throughout
            the forecast period (from 1988) stands out. We use the 15 years and older population, labour force
            participation rate, structural unemployment rate, and working hours to estimate potential labour input
            volume. All these items have been contributing to lower labour input as trends, albeit with some variation.
            In other words, the population is declining, the labour force participation rate is dropping, the structural
            unemployment rate is rising (due to wider employment mismatch), and working hours are falling. Capital
            input, meanwhile, is positive in all periods and has served as a key source adding to the potential growth
            rate. The largest positive contribution occurred in the bubble economy phase, and capital addition gradually
            declined thereafter due to progress with balance sheet contraction. The capital input downturn eased for a
            time in the late 1990s, but has steadily advanced again after the IT bubble collapse. The roughly 0.5ppt
            contribution from capital input in recent years is only about one-sixth of where it stood during the bubble
            economy period.

            TFP, meanwhile, fluctuated significantly throughout the period. This item broadly covers all factors that
            contribute to higher productivity, including deployment of production facilities with robust capabilities to
            create added value, technology progress, and increases in more skilled workers. Rising TFP reflects
            improvement in a country&apos;s overall ability to efficiently create added value from a unit of capital.
            Because of the difficulty of quantifying the extent of technology advances, worker skills, and other
            aspects, forecasts utilize the trend item for the portion of the actual growth rate not covered by capital
            and labour contributions (known as Solow&apos;s residual) as TFP.

            How much can growth strategies raise potential growth?
            Next, we turn our attention to the estimated boost to potential growth if labour and capital inputs actually
            rise by the amounts planned by Japan&apos;s growth strategies. We estimate that the potential growth rate
            would recover by 0.9ppt from 0.5% now to 1.4% in three years driven by higher capital and labour inputs
            assuming full realization of the policy effect during the concentrated investment promotion period over the
            next three years (with no questions about feasibility). Our forecast uses the following assumptions.

            While it might be coincidental, our estimates of the full impact of anticipated measures in the government&apos;s
            growth strategies show a well-balanced lift for potential growth of roughly 0.4ppt from capital input and
            0.5ppt from labour input (we keep TFP at a constant value because of forecasting difficulty but see room for
            an improvement if Japan implements concentrated investment of capital with high added value potential). If
            the growth strategies take full effect, we think the potential growth rate might exceed the level from the
            previous economic recovery phase driven by advances in emerging countries (2002-07).

            However, it does not seem realistic that the potential growth rate could rise from 0.5% now to roughly 1.4%
            in just three years. Out of capital input and labour input (rise in the employment rate), we think the
            latter is less feasible. While the goal of &quot;raising the employment rate by 5ppt through 2020&quot;
            might sound relatively easy, a review of actual trends indicates that an increase to 80% requires an
            employment recovery that significantly exceeds the past peak value (Figure 5). The employment rate for the
            20-64 year old group is determined by dividing worker volume by the total population in this group. Yet a
            rise in the employment rate linked to a shrinking denominator (population) would actually put downward
            pressure on the potential growth rate.

            In any case, we think it will be fairly difficult to increase the employment rate by 5ppt through 2020 and
            simultaneously improve the contribution of labour input to the potential growth rate. Using a more
            conservative view of employment rate improvement to roughly the past peak, we estimate a 0.1-0.2ppt lift for
            the potential growth rate from the labour input that appears more realistic (in contrast to the 0.5% boost
            implied by full implementation of proposed growth strategies).

            For capital input, meanwhile, we see a good chance of a substantial lift to the potential growth rate from
            carrying out the growth strategies. Private-sector capital investment totaled JPY61.4tn on a GDP basis in
            Jan-Mar 2013 (Figure 6; vs. JPY65.1tn in real value), and an increase of 10% during the concentrated
            investment promotion period over the next three years to roughly JPY70tn would not sharply surpass past
            economic recovery phases. This level does not appear overly aggressive to us based on a simple comparison
            with the roughly JPY80tn peak for private-sector capital investment prior to the Lehman Shock and JPY75trn
            in the bubble economy period (roughly JPY85tn in real value).

            To achieve its goal, we think the government must offer some type of tax reform, such as tax incentives that
            encourage private-sector companies to allocate roughly JPY260tn in free cash flow to capital investments. If
            it lacks alternative financial resources to fund a tax reduction, we still see leeway for tax measures that
            stimulate corporate capital investments without sacrificing tax revenue, such as extending the carry-over
            period for losses. We believe Japan is capable of raising the potential growth rate by about 0.4ppt over the
            next three years via capital input accumulation in the process of implementing growth strategies, though
            this assumes adoption of the type of tax measures described above.

            The presence of &quot;deflationary&quot; or &quot;inflationary&quot; conditions in the price environment
            will be a key determining point once demand for capital investments strengthens to the level of exceeding
            free cash flow. In other words, we think it will finally be possible to confirm a recovery in capital
            demand, the largest benefit of overcoming deflation, once core CPI begins to stabilize in positive territory
            from the second half of 2013 and the real interest rate drops to a level on par with rates in the US and
            Europe.

            The rise of long-term interest rate in light of a recovery of potential growth
            We expect the real interest rate to rise to a level that supports equilibrium over the longer term if the
            potential growth rate climbs due to real-world progress through growth strategies. A rise by the nominal
            interest rate in reaction to improved economic fundamentals would make sense too if there is a reversal of
            deflation expectations at the same time. In the final section of this report, we confirm whether the recent
            upswing of the interest rate is reasonable in the context of economic fundamentals by looking at past phases
            when potential growth was at roughly the same level.

            Figure 8 shows various scenarios for Japan&apos;s potential growth upside linked to growth strategies, and
            the situation in 2006 when the economy exhibited a similar level of potential growth. As explained above, we
            assess the interest rate in terms of: 1) potential growth rate (real equilibrium rate), 2) anticipated
            inflation factor, and 3) other risk premium, though we focus on the first two items because they can be
            readily quantified. For 2006, we set the anticipated inflation rate at 1%, for convenience, in light of the
            BoJ&apos;s &quot;understanding&quot; of price stability as a range between zero to two percent (this assumes
            that investors believe 100% in the BoJ&apos;s policy control capacity) versus the 1% potential growth rate.
            While these two fundamentals factor alone indicate a 2% fair yield, the 10yr yield traded 25bp below this
            level at 1.75% (annual average). Investors were anticipating normalization of monetary policy by the BoJ in
            2006, including rate hike expectations. We think the widening gap between deposit and loan values in Japan
            and other positive supply-demand factors for JGBs influenced the interest rate as a negative risk premium.

            In 2013, meanwhile, we estimate averages year-to-date of roughly 0.5% for the potential growth rate, or half
            of the 2006 level, and a 2% anticipated inflation rate, which is twice as high as previously. We utilize a
            2% anticipated inflation rate in light of the BoJ policy board&apos;s decision to adopt a 2% inflation
            target at its meeting on 22 January, 2013 and on the assumption that investors fully trust the Bank&apos;s
            ability to reach the 2% inflation target. These two factors together equal 2.5% and hence support a yield
            level implied by fundamentals that is higher than in 2006, despite a lower potential growth rate, because of
            the rise in anticipated inflation.

            In fact, we cannot make a simple comparison between 2006 and 2013 because the BoJ has adopted a completely
            different policy management stance and the core regime has changed. However, we think it is reasonable to
            assert that the risk premium on JGBs has sharply declined in response to the BoJ&apos;s enhanced commitment,
            taking into account adoption of an &quot;open-ended asset buying approach&quot; (22 January) and a decision
            to double asset purchase value under new-dimension monetary easing approved in April thus far in 2013. While
            the 10yr yield is trading below 1% as a result of these policies, the current situation conversely implies
            that the Bank is unlikely to rush to implement additional easing measures aimed at lowering the absolute
            level of the interest rate even if the 10yr yield climbs at a moderate pace to a level above 1%, absent an
            extreme move that brings the yield close to or above the level indicated by macro fundamentals (explained by
            the first two factors). We believe the BoJ is primarily concerned at this point about the size of 10yr yield
            fluctuation, and recent elevated interest rates should not directly weaken economic activity in our view. We
            think it is precisely this assessment that led BoJ Governor Kuroda to make the optimistic comment on 26 May
            that &quot;even if the 10yr yield climbed 1-3%, financial institution profits should benefit from increased
            lending, improved loan margin, and higher stock prices assuming that this move is accompanied by healthier
            economic and price conditions.&quot;

            If the Abenomics growth strategy subsequently takes full effect and raises Japan&apos;s potential growth
            rate to roughly 1%, on a par with the 2006 level, and the 2% inflation target is reached, enabling us to
            keep the anticipated inflation rate at 2% based on investors having complete confidence in the Bank, the
            fundamentals yield level (first two factors) moves even higher to 3%. There was a larger negative risk
            premium at that time than now, assuming that the BoJ sufficiently absorbs JGBs held by private financial
            institutions and fiscal restructuring progresses with support from a higher nominal growth rate (though we
            expect postponement of the schedule for reaching the goal of halving the primary balance deficit). However,
            we do not expect the BoJ to raise JGB purchase value and continue to add to easing policies in response to
            yield change, as long as it is accompanied by healthier economic and price conditions.

            * Among the clear weakness in the ISM report, the WSJ picks on one key line &quot;One sentence within the
            10-page Institute for Supply Management&apos;s manufacturing report may strike fear in the hearts of Federal
            Reserve officials. &quot;Customers are anticipating resin price decreases and holding back orders, according
            to a respondent in the plastic and rubber products… Regional Fed surveys also show weak pricing power among
            other manufacturers, which suggests other consumers are holding off on ordering. And the lack of demand may
            be slowing hiring… Efforts abroad to boost export activity, such as Japan’s goal of a weaker yen, will
            increase the pressure on U.S. manufacturers to cut prices. If customers act rationally and wait for the
            products they want to get cheaper, the Fed will have one more reason to make no changes in its bond-buying
            program.�
            * In contrast the news in China may just be on the turn, as increasing property prices improve the prospects
            for stronger real estate investment (and also boost local government finances, helping to reinforce the
            signs of an infrastructure spend that is finally accelerating - see the news wrap from the 23rd of May).
            Consistent with this, Bloomberg reports that &quot;China’s new home prices jumped in May by the most since
            they reversed declines in December, as the government’s efforts to tighten property curbs this year fail to
            deter buyers. Prices surged 6.9 percent from a year earlier to 10,180 yuan ($1,659) per square meter (10.76
            square feet), SouFun Holdings Ltd. (SFUN), the country’s biggest real estate website owner, said in a
            statement today after a survey of 100 cities. The costs rose 0.81 percent from April, the 12th month of
            gains on a month-on-month basis… &quot;Against the backdrop of rising land prices, supply shortages in key
            cities and expectations of looser monetary policy, the expectations for further home-price gains going
            forward remain relatively strong,� SouFun said in the statement. The average price in the 10 biggest
            cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, jumped 9.7 percent from a year earlier to 17,202 yuan per square
            meter, up 1.1 percent from April, SouFun said.�


            Lockhart Says FOMC Backs Stimulus Amid ‘Mixed Message’ on QE
            By Steve Matthews &amp; Aki Ito - Jun 4, 2013 5:17 AM GMT+1000 Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President
            Dennis Lockhart said Fed officials are committed to record stimulus even as divergent views on when to start
            paring back bond purchases create a &quot;mixed message� to investors. &quot;To the extent that the markets
            are seeing mixed messages, it simply reflects the debate that’s going on among the colleagues on the Federal
            Open Market Committee,� Lockhart said today in a Bloomberg Television interview in New York with Michael
            McKee. &quot;The bigger picture is that any adjustment is not a major policy shift.�… Lockhart, 66, said
            recent data, including a monthly decline in manufacturing, reported today by the Institute for Supply
            Management, suggest the economy isn’t strong enough to justify a reduction in bond buying. The institute’s
            factory index fell in May to 49 from the prior month’s 50.7, with 50 the dividing line between growth and
            contraction. It was the fastest decline in four years. &quot;The data we’re receiving are still very
            mixed,� said Lockhart, who doesn’t vote on policy this year. &quot;The ISM report this morning is a good
            example. I’m not getting a clear picture of an economy that really is tracking with considerable momentum.�
            &quot;I’d tend to be a little more cautious, and say maybe August, September or later in the year� would be
            time to consider slowing purchases, he said. &quot;The issue can be on the table in any of those
            meetings.�… Inflation is not an immediate concern, Lockhart said. &quot;We’re just in a spell of very soft
            inflation numbers.� &quot;Inflation expectations appear to be well anchored and measures of inflation
            expectations are really not indicating a move toward deflationary territory,� he said. Still, &quot;I don’t
            think we can dismiss downside risk related to inflation.�

            Fed’s Williams Says Sees Potential QE Taper This ‘Summer’
            By Johan Carlstrom &amp; Aki Ito - Jun 4, 2013 12:17 AM GMT+1000 Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco
            President John Williams said policy makers may start reducing the pace of bond purchases over the next three
            months and potentially end quantitative easing by year-end. With continued &quot;good signs� on jobs and
            confidence in a &quot;substantial improvement� I could see as &quot;early as this summer some adjustment,
            maybe modest adjustment downward, in our purchase program,� he said today in Stockholm. The program &quot;is
            doing this great job of helping the economy gain momentum, and I would want to see that continue well into
            the second half of this year, but if things, again if they go well, you could imagine ending the program by
            the end of the year.�

            Abe to urge review of Japan&apos;s public fund strategy -sources
            By Taro Fuse and Noriyuki Hirata Mon Jun 3, 2013 9:32pm BST - Japan&apos;s government is set to urge the
            nation&apos;s public pension funds - a pool of over trillion (1.3 trillion pounds) - to increase their
            investment in equities and overseas assets as part of a growth strategy being readied by Prime Minister
            Shinzo Abe, according to people with knowledge of the policy shift. The steps, which could be announced as
            soon as Wednesday, represent the first time the Abe administration has looked to mobilize Japan&apos;s
            massive pool of savings to support a growth agenda that aims to spur more consumer spending and corporate
            investment by pushing the economy toward 2 percent inflation

            (AUD) Coal exports climb as delays take rain check
            by: RHIANNON HOYLE From: Dow Jones June 04, 2013 12:00AM COAL shipments from Australia, the world&apos;s
            second-biggest exporter of the fuel, rose in April as key mining regions in the country&apos;s east
            recovered from torrential rains that earlier this year disrupted some mining operations and damaged
            infrastructure. Exports from major Australian coal terminals increased 5 per cent during the month to 27.55
            million tonnes, from about 26.24 million tonnes in March… Despite the monthly rise, volumes at the largest
            coal ports were down 15 per cent compared with December, before the rain damage, when exports peaked at
            32.43 million tonnes. Coal shipments fell sharply during the first few months of this year after the
            remnants of a tropical cyclone battered Queensland, the largest coal-producing state. Some rail links were
            shut for parts of February and March after severe flooding from what was the state&apos;s heaviest rainfall
            in two years, and major producers like Rio Tinto and Yancoal Australia declared force majeure on contracts
            they were not able to fulfil. Exports were up from a year earlier, with increased capacity at ports like
            Newcastle helping drive up volumes. Shipments were 6.9 per cent higher in April compared with the same month
            last year.

            Reports show economy is facing headwinds

            rate cuts on the Reserve Bank&apos;s agenda this year, but it is unlikely to move further at its board
            meeting in Sydney today… Retail sales rose by only 0.2 per cent in April following a 0.4 per cent slump the
            previous month. Sales are falling for the second month in a row at department stores and household goods
            retailers while the 0.5 per cent sales growth in the normally steady food business was the weakest for the
            year. However, Deutsche Bank chief economist Adam Boyton noted that the sales of large retailers suggested a
            better performance. Their sales rose by 0.7 per cent in April and are now 5 per cent higher than a year ago.

            Both sides buckled on party funding but voters punished Julia Gillard
            by: Dennis Shanahan, Political editor June 04, 2013 12:00AM JULIA Gillard&apos;s personal support has
            dropped to a three-month low and Tony Abbott has extended his lead as the nation&apos;s preferred prime
            minister after public outrage over plans to give the Labor and Liberal parties $10 million each in taxpayer
            funds for electioneering. Satisfaction with the way the Prime Minister is doing her job has fallen three
            points to 28 per cent in the past two weeks and dissatisfaction has risen from 59 per cent to 62 per cent,
            the highest since the end of March. And Mr Abbott has stretched his lead as preferred prime minister to
            eight points. Ms Gillard faced a revolt from her Labor MPs and a public outcry at attempts to quietly agree
            to public funding changes for political parties last week. She was forced to dump the plan when the
            Opposition Leader reneged on an agreement to back the proposal, saying he had &quot;listened&quot; to the
            public and his own MPs. The Gillard government has also been on the defensive in the past two weeks over
            fears of asbestos contamination in the rollout of the National Broadband Network fibre cable and a rash of
            illegal boat arrivals.According to the latest Newspoll survey, conducted exclusively for The Australian last
            weekend, voters have pushed the Coalition&apos;s primary vote support to a three-month high of 49 per cent,
            with Labor one point lower at 30 per cent. The shift gives the Coalition a 16 percentage point lead over the
            government after second preferences, 58 per cent to 42 per cent. Based on preference flows at the last
            election, Labor is facing a national swing against it of 8 per cent, enough to cost it 35 sitting Labor
            members if there were a uniform swing across Australia.

            without notice. This report is provided for informational purposes only. It is not an offer or a

            As a result of Deutsche Bank’s March 2010 acquisition of BHF-Bank AG, a security may be covered by more than
            one analyst within the Deutsche Bank group. Each of these analysts may use differing methodologies to value
            the security; as a result, the recommendations may differ and the price targets and estimates of each may
            vary widely.
            In August 2009, Deutsche Bank instituted a new policy whereby analysts may choose not to set or maintain a
            target price of certain issuers under coverage with a Hold rating. In particular, this will typically occur
            for &quot;Hold&quot; rated stocks having a market cap smaller than most other companies in its sector or
            region. We believe that such policy will allow us to make best use of our resources. Please visit our
            website at http://gm.db.com&lt;http://gm.db.com/&gt; to determine the target price of any stock.

            investor&apos;s currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance

            the RBS trading desks that trade as principal in the instruments mentioned herein.
            ***Or to put it graphically over the last 10 trading sessions:
            ***Better that than the JPY, eh?
            ***Or the Nikkei. Is it possible for the active futures of a bourse to court a bear market any quicker?
            ***Truth is, a lot of markets are topsy-turvy right now. In the overnight alone, US Treasuries ended the day
            largely unchanged after trading in a 12 bp range. VIX snapped above 17.5 - its highest in six weeks -- only
            to fade to a roughly unchanged 16.28 close. Credit tracked stocks closely in the session but refused to
            validate the late-day equity ramp. USD weakness supported commodities, with gold and silver up 1.70% and
            2.09% on the day, respectively. With market action like this, is it little wonder Street talk cuts so
            ambivalently?
            ***Just how ambivalent? Let&apos;s hit refresh on some of the sentiment gauges we monitor. Here&apos;s the
            Smart Money Flow Index, which maps Dow action in the &quot;emotionally-driven&quot; first 30 minutes of
            trading and the &quot;shorts-driven&quot; end of the day trading. Is a countertrend trade underway on this
            front?
            ***Here&apos;s how bullish sentiment tracked at the end of last week. It fell 13 percentage points to 39.97
            from 48.97. That brings sentiment back below the current bull market&apos;s average 38 reading for the
            period.
            ***Here&apos;s the CBoE&apos;s current put/call ratio, which is derived by dividing the total number
            (volume) of option put contracts purchased by the number of option calls. Puts are building, though the rate
            of change in the data still favours calls.
            ***Here&apos;s the latest Arms Index on daily upside/downside US equity market volume on a 21-day moving
            basis. It appears S&amp;P market trend is working against itself at current levels.
            ***Here are the numbers mapping equity upside to downside in volume terms on an intermediate-term, or 3y,
            basis...
            ...and a 10y basis. The downward trend in upside/downside volume to total volume shows the conviction of the
            bulls is on the wane.
            ***The S&amp;P&apos;s Relative Strength Index - the lower panel in the chart below -- remains in the
            dead-center of recent ranges, all the while...
            ...and the more esoteric Downside Hedge Twitter Sentiment Indicator for SPX shows weakness along with the
            general market. Note here that over the past two weeks the daily readings have been mostly positive, but
            declining. Friday saw a negative 16 reading -- the lowest print since mid-April. It is the first indication
            that traders on Twitter are becoming decidedly bearish. Individual tweets, meanwhile, are seeing a lot of
            top calling rather than calls for consolidation.
            ***Here&apos;s a benchmarking of equity market P/E ratios in the Developed Markets as expressed by the
            number of standard deviations against the five-year mean. Stocks everywhere are trading on the high side --
            but by this metric the US may be the least frothy.
            ***Here are benchmark EM equity valuations measured in the same parameters. Valuations here in Asia appear
            mixed but hardly exuberant.
            ***On the currency front, here&apos;s the CFTC numbers on USD longs as estimated by our US Strategy
            colleagues. By their lights, net longs range at 14-year highs. The USD&apos;s belaboured overnight session
            notwithstanding, imagine the short squeeze on Friday if May US Non-Farm Payrolls print weakly.
            ***Now check out the latest CFTC data on the overall net position in the US 10y for asset managers, dealers
            and leveraged money.
            ****Here are assorted government bond valuations in inflation-adjusted, standard deviation yield terms.
            ***Finally, here&apos;s Merrill&apos;s recent Fund Manager Survey comparing concerns on May 13 as opposed to
            March 13. Note the sentiment shift around market valuations.
            ***Clearly, market complacency has started to get tempered. But is it enough? After living for so long off
            central bank steroids, might we still be too sanguine?

            Best,

            FT: US funds left bruised by heavy bond losses
        </Subject>
        <MsgBody>

            US funds left bruised by heavy bond losses By Dan McCrum in New York
            Every one of the most popular class of US mutual funds investing in bonds lost money in May, highlighting
            the risks for investors as interest rates rise.

            Bond yields around the world soared from some of the lowest levels in decades last month as investors
            anticipated an end to the extraordinary measures the Federal Reserve has used to stimulate the US economy.

            US funds that invest in higher-rated bonds with average maturities of under 10 years lost an average 1.8 per
            cent in May, marking their worst performance since the depths of the financial crisis in October 2008,
            according to Lipper, a research group.

            Such a broad decline has been rare for these funds. With more than $900bn in assets, these investment
            vehicles have attracted the lion’s share of inflows from savers in search of regular income and low risk
            since the crisis.

            Bill Gross, who runs the world’s largest bond fund, Pimco’s $293bn Total Return Fund, has this year bulked
            up on US Treasuries, saying they are the safest holding in a world in which “almost all asset markets are
            bubbles and mispriced.”

            However, Treasury prices fell as yields on US 10-year government bonds rose from 1.6 per cent at the start
            of May to 2.1 per cent on Friday. The Total Return Fund lost 2.2 per cent, making it one of the worst
            performers last month, Lipper said. This year, the Pimco portfolio is down 0.5 per cent, the same as the
            average fund.

            Arvin Soh, portfolio manager for GAM, a $48bn alternative asset manager, said moves in the bond market
            reflected the activity of longer-term investors. “Very little of this has actually come from the hedge fund
            world,” he said.

            Mr Soh said few hedge funds had taken a strong view on the direction of US interest rates. “Where you are
            seeing a lot of this is on the long-only side, for instance where you saw outflows from high-yield bonds for
            the first time in three weeks.”

            Ben Bernanke, Fed chairman, last month said that bond purchases designed to hold down interest rates could
            slow in coming months as the US recovers, a shift that could have far-reaching consequences for US debt
            markets, perhaps signalling a turning point in the 30-year bull market for bonds.

            However bond funds continued to attract inflows in May: investors put $136bn into taxable bond mutual funds
            in the first five months of the year, according to Lipper, only slightly less than the $145bn of inflows
            during the same period in 2012, and ahead of flows in 2011.

            Eric Jacobson, senior analyst for Morningstar, a research group, said that one month of losses may not be
            enough to change behaviour. “The fact that it’s such a short period cuts both ways. It has the potential to
            spook people, but to really drive investors away from this market we do need to see deeper losses.”

            We hit refresh on the sentiment gauges we monitor. Clearly, market complacency has started to get tempered.
            But is it enough? After living for so long off central bank steroids, might we still be too sanguine?

            Macro Strategy
            Trading Asia Today - 4 June

            Emerging Markets | Asia FX
            4 Jun 2013
            _______________________________

            TradingAsiaToday_0604.pdf
            https://strategy.rbsm.com/7ifg1YkiLyw3kDoL9xFEgdIqCX5B87CO.rt

            A weak ISM – the weakest in almost four years – sent the USD tumbling overnight, even as Treasuries ended
            the day broadly unchanged. That the FX market reacted so much more is likely a function of record long USD
            positioning rather than from any significant shift in the outlook for the US economy. Inevitably we see a
            lower USD-Asia today, but lighter positioning should mean that moves are less significant here.
             


            While the ISM at the margin reduces the risk of tapering, Friday&apos;s employment data remains the main
            event – and continues to pose a meaningful threat to Asian currencies. We stick with our buy-USDs-on-dips
            approach.
             


            The RBA decision (at 12.30 HK/SG) is the highlight of an otherwise barren data calendar in Asia today. While
            there is little priced into today&apos;s meeting, there may be a further boost to the AUD if the RBA signals
            that it can wait till after the July inflation report to re-assess the policy rate.
             


            Asian Currencies

             

            USDINR
            Buy on dips to 56.30, target 57.30
             


            While a weaker dollar today will give some respite to INR, the broader theme of a higher USDINR remains
            intact given the absence of any local/domestic catalyst – no groundbreaking developments or reforms are
            expected in the run up to policy on 17th June. Thus, we look to buy on dips to 56.30 for a target of 57.30.
             


            USDTHB
            Stick to the 30.00-30.60 range
             


            The pair traded near the upper end of its new range but failed to break higher. We expect the pair to
            consolidate within the range and with dollar weaker overnight, the bias is for a move towards the lower end
            today.
             


            USDSGD
            Buy 1.2520, target 1.2620, stop 1.2480
             


            The USD fall overnight halted at the 50% retracement of the May low-to-high and this level should provide
            some support against which to get long. But watch SGDJPY, too: one by one, cross-yen charts have shown a
            break of trendlines, a fall into the ichimoku cloud, and ultimately a wash-out of positions. Might SGDJPY be
            next? Support is at 78.80.
             


            Indeed a number of Asia-JPY crosses look interesting at current levels:
             

            JPYKRW has yet to break either the trendline or the ichimoku cloud. At 11.40 and 11.46 respectively, there
            is still some room to go before a decisive break through, but we think there is some short positioning in
            this cross and that it is worth watching ahead of Friday&apos;s G8 meeting and US payrolls.
             


            MYRJPY – The pair is resting around the 50dma - which has been a good support in the past. A break lower
            suggests further downside to 31.90 level.
             


            THBJPY is already through support and into the ichimoku cloud. Currently it sits on lower cloud support for
            the first time since September, and as such interesting to watch if the support holds in or gives away.
             


            Meanwhile INRJPY has gone through all support, joining a long list of yen crosses – AUDJPY, NZDJPY, ZARJPY,
            BRLJPY – that have done the same.
             


            Major Currencies

             

            EURUSD
            Favour downside but watch for break higher first?
             


            The head-and-shoulders pattern below suggests a break to the downside of the 1.2800-1.3070 wedge would open
            further significant downside for the pair, but positioning remains heavily in favour of the USD: we would
            like to see a squeeze higher before re-entering shorts.
             


            USDJPY
            Buy ahead of support at 99
             


            The pair broke below 100 for the first time since early May and quickly moved to 99.00. However, the broad
            uptrend is still intact and we buy dips towards 99 support.
             


            AUDUSD
            Sell rallies to 0.9800, targeting 0.9600, stop 0.9840
             


            With the market only pricing in 4bp of a cut from today&apos;s RBA meeting, there seems little upside for
            the AUD from the rate decision itself. But confirmation that the lower exchange rate allows time for the
            central bank to assess the impact of previous cuts may confirm that the RBA is on hold until after the
            inflation print in late July. With the market pricing a July cut as an almost even bet, the risk is probably
            to the upside in AUDUSD today – but with the pair now overbought, we would sell into any rally towards the
            0.9800 level.
             


             


            Overnight Summary – from US FX Strategy
             


            US: ISM manufacturing index fell in May from 50.7 to 49.0, a weaker-than-expected result (particularly in
            the wake of better readings from the Chicago PMI, the Markit PMI, etc). The May figure, which marked the
            first decline to below breakeven (signaling contraction in the sector) since November 2011, was the weakest
            reading since the recession ended in June 2009. While the report itself suggests more sluggishness than has
            been evident in recent months, in fact, the factory sector has been stagnant (holding close to the breakeven
            level) since February. This report does not alter our view about the economy (we have been expecting subpar
            growth to persist over the course of the year). However, the sub-50 reading combined with recent downward
            revisions to estimates for Q2 real GDP (our own forecast dropped to 1.2% last Friday) should further allay
            concerns about a near-term Fed tapering, even if Friday&apos;s employment data surprise on the strong side.

            Japan: Late in the US afternoon, according to the Nikkei newspaper, sources said the Abe administration
            would urge public funds to increase holdings of risk assets and would allow the Government Pension
            Investment Fund (GPIF) to invest in alternative assets, including domestic and foreign infrastructure.
            Sources said the GPIF may include more stocks by the end of FY 2015 (April 2015).
             


            US: The final Markit US PMI was 52.3 for May versus consensus 52.0.
             


            US: April Construction Spending was +0.4% m/m vs. +0.9% expected, but March was revised from -1.7% to -0.8%.
             


            Eurozone: Former Eurogroup president Juncker said they are still not done with the crisis and said the EU
            does not have a coherent answer to unemployment. He said,&quot;...fortunately, the demons are still
            sleeping. But the north should not forget that we are facing the risk of social rebellion in parts of the
            south.&quot;
             


            Sweden: Riksbank Deputy Governor Ekholm said krona weakening is expected after the April rate path revision.
            She said data since the last meeting has been mixed, with unemployment somewhat higher than expected while
            inflation is somewhat lower than expected.
             


            Fed: Atlanta Fed President Lockhart (non-voter) said he would not rule out a reduction in QE by the summer,
            though he later commented on Bloomberg TV that the timing could be later in the year rather than in June.
             


            IMF: The IMF cut its German GDP growth forecast for 2013 to 0.3% from 0.6% and it sees 2014 GDP around 1.3%.
             


            US Rates Strategy Comment: ...Be careful what you wish for, for today was another volatile day in global
            markets and in the US Treasury market. For once it did not start with the JGB market, which posted a 4bp
            gain, but it began in the NY session with ISM coming in much weaker than expected and at its lowest level
            since June 2009....Against 2.08% in 10yrs however, the Treasury market failed, as it did last week. There
            was little indication on why the market failed and sold off from there – currencies stabilized into the
            afternoon and equities recovered their modest losses, but our flows were not indicative of the afternoon
            weakness (though MBS never traded very well today) and neither was the news flow (the late Lockhart
            commentary was the only bullet above that came in the afternoon). Nevertheless, the price action continues
            to support our belief that Treasuries will be unable to return to our old, lower yield ranges ahead of
            payrolls (with the top end defined by 2.06/2.088% - the old yield high). To be clear, we are NOT in the
            &quot;taper early&quot; camp – especially with Q2 GDP now forecast at +1.2% and the recent data coming in
            mixed – but we simply think that until we clear payrolls the markets will fear a result that is stronger
            than expected more than one weaker than expected. If we are right, it may present an opportunity heading
            into the data ... but that&apos;s three days away and in these markets that can be a lot of basis points.
            Very much unlike the market from a few months ago. As for flows, before ISM we had central bank buying of
            intermediates and real money buying of 5s and 30s. After the data we saw macro and fast money selling into
            the strength in 10s, some real money selling in 2s and 10s, bank paying in the front end, hedge fund paying
            5yr rate, bank receiving 10yr rate, and a bit later central bank buying of 3s and real money buying of 3s,
            5s, and 10s. The afternoon saw In TIPS we had real money selling in 30s and scattered buying of the belly.
            Total Treasury market inter-dealer broker volume was 95% of the 10-day average.

            WSJ: U.S. Door Swings Ajar to China IPOs
        </Subject>
        <MsgBody>
            June 3, 2013, 8:32 p.m. ET
            U.S. Door Swings Ajar to China IPOs
            By TELIS DEMOS, CHAO DENG And PRUDENCE HO
            At least four Chinese companies are considering U.S. stock exchanges for initial public offerings, possibly
            reopening a market that slammed shut in 2011 because of accounting woes at other Chinese companies that went
            public in the U.S.

            Travel website Qunar.com Inc., computer-chip maker Montage Technology and mobile-app maker 3G.cn &amp; GO
            Launcher are in various stages of discussions about possible IPOs in the U.S., according to people familiar
            with the situation.

            Drawing even more attention is Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., of Hangzhou, China, which dominates China&apos;s
            electronic-commerce market and is widely expected by analysts and investment bankers to launch an IPO with a
            valuation of tens of billions of dollars. The closely held company is debating whether to list its shares in
            Hong Kong, New York or another exchange, people familiar with the matter said.

            One Chinese company has decided on the U.S. LightInTheBox Holdings Ltd., a Beijing online retailer of
            wedding dresses, fishing rods and other items to nearly every country in the world, is trying to sell up to
            $100 million in shares. It is expected to start trading this month on the New York Stock Exchange.

            Investment bankers and analysts say even the small number of Chinese deals in the works is a sign of
            recovery from the boom and bust that rewarded but then burned investors.

            From 2009 to 2011, 67 companies from China went public in the U.S. through IPOs valued at a combined $8.26
            billion, according to Dealogic. The total since then: just two IPOs for about $166 million.

            Securities firms that assemble and pitch deals to their clients and investors who buy IPO shares in hopes of
            a profit were rattled by share-price slides, the delisting of some Chinese stocks and administrative
            proceedings brought last year by the Securities and Exchange Commission against the Chinese affiliates of
            five U.S. accounting firms for not handing over work papers for audits in China. The auditors say they are
            blocked from doing so by China&apos;s regulators.

            In May, the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board struck a pact with Chinese regulators to allow
            the U.S. regulator to see audit records and other documents of Chinese audit firms.

            Efforts are under way to reduce some of the biggest risks. For example, U.S. regulators and Chinese
            companies have agreed on language in IPO prospectuses aimed at warning investors about the potential
            downside of using a Chinese-based auditing firm, according to people familiar with the talks.

            LightInTheBox said in its IPO prospectus that &quot;investors may lose confidence in our reported financial
            information and procedures and the quality of our financial statements&quot; because U.S. officials can&apos;t
            inspect the firms that vouch for the retailer&apos;s financial statements.

            &quot;The pendulum swings,&quot; said Jim Oberweis, president and portfolio manager of Oberweis Asset
            Management Inc. The Lisle, Ill., firm manages $700 million in assets, including mutual funds that have
            bought Chinese U.S. IPOs in the past.

            For Chinese companies, the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Stock Market NDAQ -1.27%and other U.S. exchanges
            hold as much allure as ever. A U.S. listing can help up-and-coming Chinese companies boost their visibility
            in the U.S. and enhance their prestige at home. U.S.-based IPOs also are seen as a better way to reach
            global investors than selling shares in Hong Kong, though that is starting to change, some bankers say.

            One encouraging sign: The two Chinese firms that went public in the U.S. last year have surged in price.
            American depositary shares of of online retailer Vipshop Holdings Ltd. VIPS -2.20%closed Monday at $29.31
            apiece on the New York Stock Exchange, compared with their offering price of $6.50. Social-media firm YY
            Inc. YY -3.11%has risen to $27.77 from its IPO price of $10.50 on Nasdaq. Investors have been impressed by
            strong quarterly results that topped expectations implied by the IPO prices.

            Analysts say the surges show that Chinese companies still can lure U.S. investors if they are willing to
            sell shares at low enough prices to make the IPO&apos;s risks tolerable.

            Some fast-expanding, U.S.-based technology companies recently went public with stock-market values of 10 to
            20 times as much as the company&apos;s revenue in the previous year, according to Morningstar Inc. MORN
            +1.22%In contrast, YY had an initial stock-market value of less than 10 times its revenue in the year before
            the Chinese company&apos;s initial public offering.

            LightInTheBox is likely to fetch an even lower multiple to revenue because online retailers usually have
            lower profit margins than software makers. At the top end of its proposed IPO price range of $8.50 to
            $10.50, LightInTheBox would have a stock-market value of less than three times trailing revenue, according
            to a prospectus.

            &quot;I&apos;d be much more inclined to buy now at a steep discount,&quot; said Mr. Oberweis. Chinese
            accounting standards have &quot;gotten better over the last five years,&quot; he added. The firm still
            discounts &quot;in the possibility of an adverse event attributable to accounting.&quot;

            Allen Zhu, a partner in Shanghai at venture-capital firm GSR Ventures, said the &quot;appetite for Chinese
            names only just started to pick up.&quot; GSR owns a 20% stake in LightInTheBox and an undisclosed stake in
            Qunar.com.

            &quot;I don&apos;t see us going back to the same kind of levels we saw in 2007 and 2010,&quot; said Leiming
            Chen, head of the China practice at law firm Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett LLP. &quot;The big deterrent
            factor really is the perceived unfriendliness of the U.S. investor.&quot;

            Elite in China Molded in Part by Tiananmen
            By ANDREW JACOBS and CHRIS BUCKLEY
            Published: June 3, 2013 Comment
            BEIJING — For four days, more than 400 of China’s brightest political minds gathered in smoke-clouded halls
            at a Beijing hotel, vigorously debating the nation’s future.

            It was April 1989, and after a decade of economic transformation, China faced a clamor for political
            liberalization. Days later, protests erupted in Tiananmen Square, and the lives of those at the meeting took
            radically different turns. Several are now national leaders, including Li Keqiang, China’s prime minister.
            Others ended up in prison or exile, accused of supporting the demonstrations that shook the Communist Party
            and ended with soldiers sweeping through the city on June 4, shooting dead hundreds of unarmed protesters
            and bystanders.

            “The atmosphere at the meeting was to let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend,”
            said Chen Yizi, who helped organize the conference. “Afterwards, it was impossible to hold a meeting like
            that where everyone was willing to debate different points of view.”

            This year is the 24th anniversary of the bloodshed, and the first under a party leadership dominated by
            officials with such intimate and ambivalent ties to the events of 1989. Many top leaders served their
            political apprenticeship in the 1980s, when the boundaries between the permissible and the forbidden were
            not as stark and heavily policed as they are now. Their careers and friendships, and sometimes their
            viewpoints, overlapped with intellectuals, officials and policy advisers who were jailed or dismissed after
            the June 4 crackdown.

            Few expect China’s new leaders, installed in November, to overturn the official verdict that the protests
            were a counterrevolutionary rebellion that had to be crushed. But the immersion of today’s leaders in the
            political experimentation of the 1980s raises the question of whether they will be more open to new ideas
            and discussion than their immediate predecessors in high office.

            Chinese leaders openly debate competing approaches to the economy, but their calls for political
            liberalization have become increasingly rare. For now, at least, any potential embrace of the more
            freewheeling spirit of the 1980s appears to be hindered by the conformism demanded of those who have
            ascended in the hierarchy — and their dread of being accused of ideological heresy.

            Yet the lessons of June 4 and its repressive aftermath may weigh on the new leaders, especially if they are
            confronted by another political uprising, said Wu Wei, a former aide to Zhao Ziyang, the reform-minded party
            leader ousted shortly before the crackdown.

            “For those in power now, it’s still a heavy political burden, even if it’s one that they can never openly
            discuss,” Mr. Wu said. “Now the people who took part in that time are middle-aged or older, and it’s still a
            knot in their hearts.”

            Prime Minister Li, now 57, was one of six current members of the elite 25-member Politburo who attended the
            meeting, according to Zhong Dajun, an editor for the official Xinhua news agency at the time. Others
            included Li Yuanchao, the vice president; Wang Qishan, the chief of anti-corruption investigations; and Yu
            Zhengsheng, who deals with policy toward religious groups, ethnic minorities and nonparty groups.

            Many of these future Chinese leaders were among the hundreds of thousands of students who crowded into
            universities beginning in the late 1970s, eager for knowledge after years of rote-learning Mao Zedong
            Thought during the Cultural Revolution, when colleges were mostly shut or paralyzed by ideological
            campaigns. Photographs showed them dressed in the blue or green cotton coats of the Mao era, a reminder of
            the drab conformity they yearned to escape.

            Throughout the Tiananmen upheaval, Xi Jinping, the nation’s current president, was a local official in
            Fujian Province in China’s southeast, far from the protests in Beijing. But his father, Xi Zhongxun, a
            veteran Communist turned supporter of economic reform, had been a friend of Hu Yaobang, the Communist Party
            leader demoted in 1987 for his liberal tendencies and whose death in 1989 sent thousands swarming into
            Tiananmen Square to voice their grief and demand steps toward democracy.
            There are some indications that the elder Mr. Xi obliquely signaled opposition to martial law but stepped
            into line after June 4, said Warren Sun, a historian at Monash University in Australia.

            At the time, China had abandoned the ideological zealotry of Mao’s era and pursued market reforms under Deng
            Xiaoping that allowed farmers, factories and traders to escape state fetters. The economic changes were
            accompanied by a ferment of new ideas and calls for political opening and cultural renovation, despite
            counteroffensives against “spiritual pollution” led by conservatives.

            “What we all shared was the belief that China had to reform, and to do so urgently,” said Chen Ziming, a
            writer. “The only real division among students and scholars was whether to reform the economy first, or take
            on political reform first, or do both at the same time.”

            Many of China’s current leaders started climbing the political ladder in this febrile atmosphere, when it
            was not unusual for officials to mix with advocates of more radical change, and even to show some sympathy
            for them. As a student, Li Keqiang socialized with Hu Ping and Wang Juntao, two firebrands who threw
            themselves into the unbridled student elections of 1980. Friends say Mr. Li sometimes joined in campus
            salons, where students stayed up late into the night debating electoral politics, Western philosophy and the
            excesses of authoritarian rule.

            Later, friends say, Mr. Li was cajoled by party officials into giving up the chance to study abroad and
            instead became a cadre in the Communist Youth League.

            “At the time, we had a lot of views in common,” said Mr. Wang, who was jailed after June 4 and left for the
            United States in 1994. “A lot of the issues that came to divide us hadn’t arisen yet.”

            Other future leaders came from similar backgrounds. Wang Qishan, the current anticorruption chief, won
            prominence in the early 1980s as one of the “four reform gentlemen,” young intellectuals who advocated
            shifting away from a rigidly planned economy. Later that decade, he sat on the editorial committee of Toward
            the Future, a series of books avidly read by students.

            Chen Yizi, the former leader of the government institute that organized the Beijing conference, recalled
            having long chats with Mr. Wang and one long conversation with Mr. Li in 1988. Referring to China’s recently
            retired leadership, Mr. Chen said, “This generation should be more enlightened than Hu Jintao, Wen Jiabao
            and their generation.”

            By 1989, divisions were tearing at the Communist leadership. Despite a decade of economic growth, students
            and intellectuals were dismayed by corruption and the party’s reluctance to emulate the changes sweeping the
            Soviet bloc. The broader public was also irate about official privilege and price reforms that had unleashed
            inflation.

            Those tensions flared after the death of Hu Yaobang, when the mourning in Tiananmen Square escalated into
            demands to curtail the power and privilege of the party’s elite through steps to democracy and free speech.

            Mr. Zhao and other relatively moderate members of the party hierarchy advocated measured political
            liberalization and press freedoms to defuse discontent. But hard-liners argued that liberalization was a
            menace, not a cure. They had the backing of Mr. Deng, who was more enthusiastic about economic reforms than
            about political compromise.

            Wang Juntao, the democracy advocate, recalled meeting Li Keqiang, his former university acquaintance, for a
            last time in mid-May 1989, when Mr. Li was among a group of officials trying to coax students to end a
            hunger strike and return to class. “As a student, he used to speak his mind,” Mr. Wang said. “Now some of
            that pushiness was gone. He’d become an official who deferred to his superiors, but I still think he had a
            sense of justice.”

            By the time the government declared martial law in Beijing on May 20, Mr. Zhao’s authority was broken, and
            Mr. Deng and party conservatives prepared a harsher response to students clogging Tiananmen Square. Two
            weeks later, soldiers and tanks plowed toward the square, and China went through a convulsion of purges and
            imprisonments.

            To navigate these reversals, former acquaintances said Mr. Li and other Communist Youth League officials
            showed a ruthless pragmatism to ward off suspicions of disloyalty, taking steps that included attending
            meetings at which they denounced the protests as counterrevolutionary. “To survive in the party, you have to
            become an opportunist,” Mr. Wang said.

            Soon after the June 4 crackdown, Xi Jinping’s wife, Peng Liyuan, a singer in a military troupe, was among
            the performers who entertained troops in Tiananmen Square. Photographs of her performance, published in a
            People’s Liberation Army magazine in 1989, spread briefly on the Chinese Internet this year before
            disappearing — a reminder of the sensitivities of that time.

            “The party system changes people,” said Mr. Wu, the former official. “Once you go down that path, you learn
            that to defend yourself, you have to defend the system. But I don’t believe that era left no traces on
            them.”

            Investor attitudes in Japan shifting away from low yielding JGBs
            The Japanese government is pushing government managed pension funds to take more risk and reallocate away
            from bonds to stocks and other riskier investments according to the Nikkei. It says such funds are worth
            around JPY200tn, including JPY120 tn managed by the Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF). They are
            setting up a panel this month to make recommendations. The reallocation is said to be done by end of Fiscal
            2015 (March 2016).

            These funds currently are heavily weighted to JGBs. Although they are no longer net buyers of JGBs, since
            they are now paying out more to meet pension payments (4-6tn per year by the GPIF). While these
            reallocations are not imminent and will happen gradually, they add to downside risk for JGBs, more so at the
            long end, and should support equities. They may also recommend buying more foreign assets. Such news may
            reflect a broader shift in psychology underway in Japan that lends itself to more risk taking including
            investing abroad, thus tending support a weaker JPY trend.

            The BoJ is reported to be considering lengthening its cheap term loans out to two years to encourage banks
            to take more carry trades in JGBs. This may work with even 2 year JGB yields (14bp) again above the cash
            rate of 10bp (where these loans are fixed). So it will have some influence in anchoring the yield curve.
            Clearly long term yields can still swing considerably from 2yr yields, but this is consistent with broader
            efforts by the BoJ to damp down JGB volatility. As discussed yesterday, lower volatility in JGBs is likely
            to underpin Japanese equities and resume the rally in USD/JPY.

            Asia data weak
            PMI reports in Asia were generally underwhelming tending to give reason for the recent weaker performance in
            Asian currencies.

            The national Chinese manufacturing PMI rose from 50.6 to 50.8 in May, better then 50.0 expected. This might
            suggest stability in activity, and perhaps hint of a modest improvement up from the low in August last year
            at 49.2. However, this data is more weighted to the larger state-owned enterprises. Bloomberg reports that
            the government PMI for smaller companies fell from 47.6 to 47.3.

            This later figures gels with the HSBC/Markit PMI which is biased towards private companies. It was revised
            down to 49.2 in May, from the flash estimate two weeks ago of 49.6, well down from 50.4 in April and below
            an expected unchanged result.

            This weaker read is also consistent with the Taiwan PMI that slumped from 50.7 to 47.1, a low since
            September last year. The S.Korean PMI fell from 52.6 to 51.1 in May, a low since February. These close
            trading partners with China may provide a clue as to the trend in China. They may also reflect the increased
            competition from a weaker JPY. The Indian PMI fell from 51.0 to 50.1, well below average levels of recent
            years.

            China&apos;s services sector fell from 54.5 to 54.3 in May, a low since September last year. While the
            services sector may be further above the 50 line, it is in a slowing trend since this series began in 2011.

            Such news and the recent slump in iron ore prices in China continue to weigh on the outlook for commodity
            markets and the AUD. There was a $1.50 uptick in spot iron ore to $111.90 on Monday, after a $12.80 slump
            last week. 12mth forward iron ore priced also rose $1.10 to $109.33 on Monday, after a $2.6 fall last week.
            However, Chinese steel prices continued to edge lower; an average of 5 products was down 0.3% on Monday,
            after falling 1.8% last week. The chart below shows steel prices approaching the lows last year in
            September. The pattern over the last two years has been a slump around mid-year. The fall this year has
            occurred a bit earlier. There are some reports that iron ore inventories have been wound down, providing
            some hope of price stability. But it may also reflect a lack of confidence in steel demand. At this stage
            the lower steel prices are consistent with weaker activity reports in China

            In contrast to the other Asian data, on Friday Japan reported its PMI up from 51.1 to 51.5 in May. Not yet
            booming, but the best result since August 2011. Labour cash earnings data turned slightly positive from
            -0.9%y/y (revised lower from -0.6%) in March to +0.3%y/y in April. This is the best result since March 2013.
            It is an important goal of the Abe government to get wages higher in pursuit of inflation.

            European PMIs improving trend
            European PMIs also showed an improving trend although remain below 50, and thus indicative of only a slower
            rate of decline. The Eurozone PMI rose from 46.7 in April to 48.3 in May, revised up from the flash read two
            weeks ago of 47.8. The Spanish PMI rose from 44.7 in April to 48.1. The French PMI rose from 44.4 in April
            to 46.4 in May.

            ECB President Draghi said yesterday, &quot;The economic situation in the euro area remains challenging but
            there are a few signs of a possible stabilisation, and our baseline scenario continues to be one of a very
            gradual recovery starting in the latter part of this year.&quot;

            These comments suggest we may get only a modest downward revision to growth and inflation forecasts this
            year by the ECB staff on Thursday. Most forecasters see no policy rate cut this week. Our economists say it
            will be a &quot;close call, but on balance rates will remain on hold&quot; (at 0.50%), and they see little
            chance that the deposit rate currently at zero is cut to sub-zero signalling a shift to target negative cash
            rates. The EUR continues to look relatively stable

            The UK PMI was 51.3 in May, from 50.2 in April (revised up form 49.8), and quite a bit stronger than 50.3
            expected. This is the best result since March-2012. like for like retail sales were reported this morning up
            1.8%y/y, up from -2.2% in April, above +1.3% expected. Total retail sales rose 3.5%y/y. The data is not
            especially strong, but suggest the economy is on an improving path. The data is likely to tilt the BoE
            further from policy easing and no change is expected this week.

            US dollar weaker, buy US yields remain elevated

            The USD was weaker on Monday it seems on the weaker ISM Manufacturing indexed that fell from 50.7 to 49.0 in
            May, well below 51.0 expected. This is the lowest result since 2009, and thus may indicate the US economy is
            again faltering. However the Markit version of the PMI released a bit earlier was revised up from a flash
            estimate of 51.9 to 52.3 in May, up a bit from 52.0 in April. The market pays more attention to the ISM
            report, but the banjos are duelling.

            It appears that the US economy, particularly manufacturing has lost some momentum in recent months. However,
            consumer confidence is reported recently to be the highs since 2008. Our US economist is forecasting a
            modest and below trend growth rate of 1.2% in Q2 and is still predicting Fed policy tapering as a distance
            away, perhaps not this year, on the basis that the recovery and employment growth remain sub-trend.

            However, the softer PMI data had little impact on US yields that remain elevated over the last month, which
            is not really consistent with the weaker USD in recent sessions against the other majors.

            US yields have risen more than other major markets around the 5 year level. This might be consistent with
            the improving confidence that the US economy will eventually reach a point when the Fed exits QE and raises
            rates in the next few years, even if QE tapering may not begin as soon as some expect.
            (charts of EUR and JPY vs 5 year swap rate spreads)

            RBA on hold, but some risk they acknowledge weaker economic outlook
            We expect the RBA to stay on hold today, but confidence in the economic outlook remains subdued. There has
            been on balance weaker than expected reports over the last two months, and anecdotes suggest that the mining
            sector has retreated in recent months, spooked by weaker commodity prices and may be moving slower on
            investment projects. Job ads reported yesterday were down 2.4%m/m in May, and revised weaker from -1.3% to
            -1.7% in April, the third decline in a row, consistent with recent reports of weaker business confidence.
            Retail sales rose a modest 0.2%m/m after falling 0.4% m/m in March. House prices surprising fell 1.2% in
            May, after a 0.5% fall in April, which seems at odds with reports of high rates of clearances at auctions
            and improving trends in housing finance.

            The RBA will probably acknowledge that the weaker AUD may help boost business confidence. It may avoid
            saying this lessens its scope to ease policy, but clearly it does. It is possible they acknowledge the
            outlook for activity has deteriorated a bit more this year, but the likelihood is that continue to promote
            the idea of modest below trend growth returning to trend next year, supported by their low rates policy.

            With the near term direction uncertain for the USD and US payrolls report on Friday, we advise keeping
            powder dry. Our bias remains to sell AUD/USD and buy USD/JPY, but still think we need some what better
            levels towards .9850 in AUD and 98.00 in USD/JPY, or more clarity around the stability in Japanese markets
            and the state of US employment.

            Emerging Markets | EM Top View | Asia
            4 Jun 2013
            There are conflicting signs from the two major closely watched PMI surveys about China&apos;s economy. We
            assess their characteristics and track record to decide which is better at providing signals on upcoming
            growth momentum for China&apos;s industry.

            This weekend China&apos;s official manufacturing PMI provided some relief on growth, with the headline index
            up from 50.6 in April to 50.8 in May, supported by higher readings for the production component (see PMI
            data provides relief on growth&lt;https://strategy.rbsm.com/Tools/Content/ContentViewer.aspx?ContentID=343513&amp;menuKey=234&amp;searchTag=Louis+Kuijs&amp;source=ContentList&gt;,
            3 Jun 2013).

            However, on Monday morning the Markit-HSBC (MH) manufacturing PMI showed a much less favourable picture,
            falling from 50.4 in April to 49.2 in May, dragged down by a full 2.5 points decline in the new order
            component to 48.7.

            Amidst a lack of clear direction in the hard activity data and concerns in the market about China&apos;s
            growth outlook, which PMI should we look at for information about short-term growth prospects?

            Seasonality issues and difference in coverage matter but they do not give the full answer

            Traditionally, the official PMI is not fully adjusted for seasonal patterns. The methodology to compile the
            official PMI was changed in early 2013. However, the NBS, which reports the results, has stated that the
            change in methodology does not affect the comparison with the data before 2013. Thus, although we are not
            fully certain, we assume that the traditional seasonal patterns still apply in 2013 and we take these into
            account in our analysis (Figure 1).

            One possible reason why the two PMIs sometimes give different signals is that their coverage differs. Large
            and state-owned firms and companies catering to the domestic market are more strongly represented in the
            official PMI than in the MH one. In the case of size and ownership, the differences in coverage have
            actually not played a major role in recent years, as the cycle has not really differed much along those
            dimensions.

            We have seen some differences in the cycle between export-oriented firms and domestic demand-oriented ones.
            When the cyclical weakness is particularly pronounced in exports, the MH PMI is less strong than the
            official one. Indeed, the MH PMI correlates better with exports (Figure 2). However, we look to the PMI to
            provide information on the overall manufacturing cycle, not just on exports.

            The sensitivity to exports did not really differentiate the two gauges much during the global financial
            crisis as, at end-2008, domestic demand in China weakened as rapidly as exports. However, this difference in
            coverage may in part explain why the MH PMI strengthened substantially more than the official one in Q4 2012
            (Figures 2 and 3).

            Another point on coverage is that the sample for the official PMI contains more and larger firms compared to
            the MH survey (3000, since January 2013, vs. 430).

            What about the track record?
            We look at the behaviour in the last several years. In principle, the PMIs say something about mom growth in
            manufacturing. Therefore, we first compare the two PMIs to mom growth in value added in industry (&quot;industrial
            production&quot;, or IP) (Figure 4). We use IP growth because it is readily available, while growth in
            industry and in manufacturing are quite similar. We seasonally adjust the official PMI.

            One general difference is that the MH PMI tends to be a bit more volatile, showing more abrupt changes,
            compared to the smoother pattern of the official one, probably in part because of the smaller sample size.
            The abrupt changes generally do not seem to provide a lot of information on upcoming changes in IP growth
            (Figure 4).

            The two PMIs usually broadly move in the same direction. There are no major differences in 2009-10 (Figure
            2).

            The comparison to sequential growth is not revealing a lot. The NBS&apos;s estimate of mom IP growth does
            not show a lot of variation. Comparing the PMI readings with our own estimates of 3mma mom IP growth,
            neither of the PMIs has provided a lot of information about current or upcoming changes in IP growth (Figure
            4). The MH PMI went up in end-2012 and down in early 2013, as did 3mma mom IP growth. However, it lagged
            rather than led IP growth, even compared to the 3mma.

            Therefore, we end up comparing the PMIs with yoy IP growth (Figure 3). The comparison shows they carry
            information but both sometimes miss the boat, suggesting a change in growth in industry that does not
            materialise, especially the MH one.

            * At end-2011, the MH first showed an uptick, and then an abrupt drop, while yoy growth in IP continued to
            slow gradually through the start of 2012 (Figure 3). The seasonally adjusted (SA) official PMI was less
            misleading in most of H2 2011.
            * However, the SA official PMI showed a pronounced rise in late 2011-early 2012 that did not coincide with
            or presage a rise in yoy IP growth. On the contrary, IP growth weakened later in 2012.
            * In Q4 2012, the MH PMI rose significantly more steeply than the SA official one. As noted, this was in
            part because of a pick up in the new export orders component. In any case, it exaggerated the pick up in IP
            growth around that time (Figure 3).
            * In early 2013, the MH PMI first picked up and then started to slide. Meanwhile, the SA official PMI first
            declined and then picked up. So far, the pattern of yoy IP growth in early 2013 has been correlated more
            closely with the SA official PMI.

            What do key components say?
            The two most important components of the PMI are production and orders. Their shares in the official PMI are
            25% and 30%, respectively. To avoid seasonality issues, we look at yoy changes.

            Normally (yoy changes in) the new order components and the production components of the two PMIs move quite
            closely together (Figures 5 and 6). The new order component of the official PMI is slightly quicker in
            picking up changes and inflection points; in the case of the production components the difference between
            the two PMIs is smaller.

            However, the new order components and the production components picked up in early 2012 in both PMIs even as
            yoy IP growth declined. That is, in the case of both PMIs, increases in these key components were not
            matched by higher yoy growth in industry (sequential IP growth did not rise either).

            Since Q4 2012, some divergence has taken place in both the new order components and production components.
            At first sight, in early 2013, the order component of the official PMI presaged upcoming changes in IP
            growth slightly better than the one in the Markit-HSBC PMI.

            How about massaging the official PMI to boost confidence?
            Unfortunately, due to the institutional setting in which data is collected and compiled in China, concerns
            about influencing economic data persist. In the case of the PMI, people sometimes worry that the official
            PMI could at times be inflated to boost confidence.

            However, it is not easy to find good evidence for this. In late 2008, the official PMI tanked together with
            the MH one, even though the government wanted to boost confidence. In 2012, China&apos;s business sector
            started the year with confidence, reflected in the rise in the PMI noted above. However, since early 2012
            the official PMI gradually weakened even as the government was trying to instil confidence.

            In all, while we cannot a priori rule out a bias in the official PMI, the empirical evidence does not point
            to it.

            Takeaways
            In our view, neither of the PMIs is conclusive as a proxy or predictor of growth in industry. While the MH
            PMI is very useful as a guide to the state of the export oriented manufacturing, our look at the
            characteristics and track record suggests that the official PMI tends to carry more information about
            upcoming overall growth in industry.

            In this context, we feel comfortable with our judgement that the increase in the official manufacturing PMI
            in May points to continued expansion in China&apos;s industry, supported by reasonable domestic demand.
            Growth in China&apos;s industry is not yet fully convincing and broad-based while the still subdued export
            picture – reflected in a relatively weak Markit-HSBC PMI – poses risks to the economic outlook for the rest
            of 2013. But the domestic momentum creates a floor for growth, providing some comfort to policy makers.

            Gibbs:RBA willing to cut further, but approaching the limits of scope to ease
        </Subject>
        <MsgBody>
            Greg Gibbs&apos; thoughts on RBA: Market pricing of rate cuts is about right. The RBA appear willing to cut
            a bit more to support growth, but are suggesting they are reaching the limits of scope to ease. This
            statement aims to say less and leave their options open.

            The RBA still sees scope to cut, but is less certain with &quot;would afford&quot; changed to &quot;may
            provide some&quot;

            The statement today said, &quot;the inflation outlook, as currently assessed, may provide some scope for
            further easing.&quot;

            In May it said, &quot;the inflation outlook would afford scope to ease further&quot; and that &quot;it
            decided to use some of that scope&quot;

            In April it said, &quot;The inflation outlook, as assessed at present, would afford scope to ease policy
            further&quot;

            The final paragraph says, &quot;It decided that the stance of monetary policy remained appropriate for the
            time being&quot;.

            In April, the last time policy was held steady, they said, &quot;the Board judged that it was prudent to
            leave the cash rate unchanged.&quot;

            The addition of &quot;for the time being&quot; suggests that policy makers see a high probability that they
            will ease rates in coming meetings.

            However, they are not convinced rates will be cut further. They suggest the current rate settings may do the
            job. They said, &quot;the Board judged that the easier financial conditions now in place will contribute to
            a strengthening of growth over time, consistent with achieving the inflation target&quot;

            The RBA still describe the AUD as high. It said, &quot;The exchange rate has depreciated since the previous
            Board meeting, although, as the Board has noted for some time, it remains high considering the decline in
            export prices that has taken place over the past year and a half.&quot;

            This statement is shorter, dropping detail on the economic conditions and the inflation outlook. The
            impression left is that they do not wish to add more than already said in recent statements. Perhaps they
            decided to say less to give the market less to interpret, and keep their options open in coming meetings
            when they hope to have a stronger view on the need for policy change.

            They said, the outlook is for growth is a &quot;bit below trend&quot;, and inflation &quot;consistent with
            the medium term target&quot;

            The rates market initial reaction is to push rates on the front part of the curve up by 4 to 5bp since the
            statement and 3 to 4 since the start of the day. The odds of a 25bp cut in July are around 33% chance, In
            August (after the next inflation report) they are 65%, and a full 25bp cut is not fully priced until
            October. The low point on the rates curve is 2.40% (35bp below current level) in February next year.

            AUD is a bit higher at .9725 (up from .9715 ahead of the statement), but down from .9760 this morning. So
            the performance of the AUD looks soggy.

            Statement by Glenn Stevens, Governor: Monetary Policy Decision
            At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.75 per cent.

            Information becoming available since the previous meeting is consistent with global growth running a bit
            below average this year, with reasonable prospects of a pick-up next year. Commodity prices have declined
            from their peaks but, overall, remain at high levels by historical standards. Inflation has generally
            moderated over recent months and monetary policy has been eased further in a number of countries.

            Financial conditions internationally are very accommodative. Despite the recent rise in sovereign bond
            yields, funding conditions for sovereigns, well-rated corporates and most financial institutions remain very
            favourable.

            In Australia, growth over the past year has been a bit below trend. The outlook published by the Bank last
            month is for a similar performance in the near term and recent data are consistent with this. The
            unemployment rate has edged higher over the past year and growth in labour costs has moderated. Inflation
            has been consistent with the medium-term target and is expected to remain so over the next one to two years.

            The easing in monetary policy over the past 18 months has supported interest-sensitive areas of spending and
            has been reflected in portfolio shifts by savers and higher asset values. Further effects can be expected
            over time. The pace of borrowing has thus far remained relatively subdued, though recently there have been
            some signs of increased demand for finance by households. The exchange rate has depreciated since the
            previous Board meeting, although, as the Board has noted for some time, it remains high considering the
            decline in export prices that has taken place over the past year and a half.

            At today&apos;s meeting the Board judged that the easier financial conditions now in place will contribute
            to a strengthening of growth over time, consistent with achieving the inflation target. It decided that the
            stance of monetary policy remained appropriate for the time being. The Board also judged that the inflation
            outlook, as currently assessed, may provide some scope for further easing, should that be required to
            support demand.

            Overnight News

            * UK BRC like-for-like retail sales better than expected up 1.8% y/y in May
            * RBA leaves policy rate at 2.75% but retains dovish stance; AUD considered still high despite recent
            declines

            FOREIGN EXCHANGE

            * USD softer after weak US data but should remain supported ahead key US releases later this week
            * EUR/USD upside limited ahead of ECB meeting


            USD

            US Manufacturing ISM surprised on the downside yesterday falling back in to contractionary territory to 49.0
            in May, while the UK manufacturing PMI moved back into expansionary territory and the Eurozone surveys were
            revised higher, albeit remaining sub-50 (chart 1 on page 2). This divergence in the ISM/PMIs is opposite to
            what we have seen in recent months, which may suggest that optimism towards the US may have peaked. However,
            this disappointing print looks unlikely to be sufficient to turn the recent USD sentiment around, with US
            services ISM and ADP employment report released tomorrow ahead of May US payrolls released on Friday.

            EUR

            Italian and Spanish Manufacturing PMIs came in better than expected yesterday and upward revisions to
            French, German and the aggregate Eurozone index helped support EUR/USD, and traded higher following the
            weaker US number. However, EUR/USD upside maybe limited ahead of the ECB meeting on Thursday. While we do
            not expect a rate cut at this meeting, there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding possible commentary from
            Draghi at the press conference. However, while he may maintain a dovish tone, verbal intervention looks
            limited.

            GBP

            Yesterday&apos;s UK Manufacturing PMI was better-than-expected, rising to a 14-month high at 51.3; that and
            weaker US data saw GBP/USD push sharply higher, trading through the 1.5350 level. Today&apos;s construction
            PMI may attract some market attention, but typically the survey has little correlation with the official
            output numbers. Tomorrow&apos;s services PMI will likely be a greater focus. GBP/USD remains vulnerable by
            USD sentiment with key releases later this week. The 1.5380 area should provide good initial resistance for
            GBP/USD; for EUR/GBP, we think bias remains to the downside ahead of the ECB meeting.

            JPY

            USD/JPY broke below the 100.00 level yesterday, trading below that level for the first time since 9th May.
            Risk reversals turned lower last week, moving in favour of USD puts and we see increased risks of a
            correction in the broad JPY downtrend seen since the start of the year. JPY net positioning is significantly
            short, extending further to new record highs in the week to 28th May, this break below the 100 level
            suggests scope for further JPY gains on position squaring.


            INTEREST RATES

            * Expectations for US economic data flow and JGB market liquidity conditions still in the driving seat

            * £1.6bn reopening of IL24s: good absolute value, but incomplete RV cheapening

            10-year UST futures are little moved, this morning, amid rallying Japanese equities and with 10-year JGB
            yields trading above 85bp, after the 10-year auction recorded the largest tail since Sep-10, for a 3.14 b/c.
            The idea that the single most important driver of global yields at the current junction is the US economic
            dataflow found additional confirmation with the market reaction to the &apos;below-50&apos; ISM
            manufacturing for May, with the 10-year UST yield dropping 7bp and the 10-year gilt yield dropping 3bp on
            the news. Bottom line: keep an eye on US trade data, today. Don&apos;t let yourself get too distracted by
            the ADP employment report, tomorrow. And keep your mind focussed on Friday&apos;s labour market report (for
            NFP, LBCB expects 183K versus Bloomberg median of 168K).

            Current core yield levels might not be justified at this stage of the global economic and policy cycle,
            especially considering the risks stemming from the fiscal drag in the US and the remaining uncertainties in
            the euro area, but perceptions and positioning will be key. Positioning data are not providing a strong
            reversal signal yet: As of 22 may COB, i.e. just after Bernanke&apos;s testimony, Non-commercial accounts in
            UST futures and futures options had an overall net short position of about $15bn, in 10-year DV01
            equivalents, the first overall net short since mid-February, with net longs that had peaked at $43bn on the
            same measure at the end of April. The implied positioning was clearly for a steeper curve: non-commercials
            were net long for 5bn in the 5-year contract, and net short 3bn in the 10Y, 7.1 in the 30-year and 9.2 in
            the ultra-long futures contract.


            UK gilt markets will focus on Construction PMI (Bloomberg survey: 49.8) and on the £1.6bn reopening auction
            of IL24s (about £2mn/bp), which will bring the amount outstanding to about £7.1bn (about £7.29bn in uplifted
            terms). At -0.785% its real yield is about 35bp lower than at launch, back in Oct, but also almost 50bp
            higher than the low of -1.27% recorded in Apr. The March-maturity IL24 &apos;RV appeal&apos; has been pared
            somewhat over the past few sessions (Chart 2). With the most recent UK economic prints surprising on the
            upside (and the Lloyds Business Barometer for May signalling further improvement) market attention might
            re-focus on the likely re-acceleration in RPI inflation, providing a favourable context for the auction.
            Having said that, in light of the most recent richening, the RV set-up looks not completely convincing (also
            considering the need to fears of a repeat of disappointing post-auction trading after the 2 Apr reopening)
            and we would expect some additional RV concession into the sale.

            Have we seen the flush out? JPY option thoughts from Andy Soper
        </Subject>
        <MsgBody>
            From Andy Soper :
            Through this entire wash out in risk I haven’t felt it worthwhile pushing ideas for a bounce back in USDJPY
            but today I feel it’s worth pointing out a few things.

            - Firstly, USD longs are lighter than they have been in this pair for a while yet we are about to enter a
            period of extreme interest in the region.
            - We’ve clearly missed the extreme low but sometimes you need to see the bounce to feel you have indeed
            touched the lows.
            - The Nikkei managed to find a bid tone off the back of some equity wobbles in Europe.
            - There is now a lot of barrier noise around 103/104 which if broken, would suggest the mkt isn’t as short
            JPY as they would like.
            - We continue to see media reports about future public pension investments.
            - Abe talks tomorrow about growth strategy.
            - More reports on BOJ considering long dated funding operations as they continue to tackle the JGB issues.
            - A BOJ meeting coming up in the 1w where the potential for a strong reply to recent mkt volatility could be
            a bigger mover than the April meeting. I think this one is important because as we run into the Elections in
            July Abe needs to show that his policy is working so he only has a few meetings to achieve this. It’s no
            good leaving a big push to the meeting the week or so before the election, the damage could have been done
            by then.
            - On these moves, the RR in USDJPY has flipped to pay for downside yet this can often be seen as the time in
            which USD Calls become most valuable.

            Buying cash outright is a brave move through these conditions as regardless of all the above, one weak $
            piece of data and we’re back testing the downside. Outright vol buying is very expensive even though there
            is no premium to buy topside compared to a 1mth RR as high as 1.5 vols a few mths ago.

            With this in mind I suggest some of the following as worth considering. Please note I have chosen the 6w
            date as it passes through the July NFP and the 11 July BOJ but misses the July Elections as I feel the
            premium for that date is quite high and my view is Abe would have done what is required by then so why spend
            the money. Either that or we will all be buying 90 strikes !

            100.35 Spot ref all 6w ( 16/18 Jul Expiry ).

            Buy a 103/105 call sprd with a KI @107 on the 105 for 45 bps net 21% sdelta.

            Do the same sprd in 1x1.5 notional for 23.5 bps 5% sdelta.

            Buy a 102/104 call sprd with a KI @106 in 1x1.5 notional for 27 bps, 5% sdelta.

            Or buy a 6w 105 digital for 18% or a 106 for 14%.

            Happy to look at other ideas.

            Hello: just a few thought and colour from the sales side

            The bonds have taken a hit together with the rest of Emerging Markets. But, in fairness, a lot of the
            sell-off until the last few sessions was not specific to Venezuela headlines ONLY. It is true, the Venezuela
            picture is not one that fills you with confidence, and maybe the sell off was an excuse to get out of
            positions some felt uncomfortable with anyway, particularly Real Money accounts - even with the carry. The
            past few days have been full of speculation and rumours, some relative good news and other unsavory ones:
            Merentes announced a ¨non-deal¨roadshow to disipate rumours and answer questions regarding the economy,
            yesterday rumors maybe of further devaluation; on a daily basis scarcity problems exacerbating, a few days
            ago tapes emerged with indication that the election might have been rigged - which the government has
            practically ignored, not to mention the dreadful inflation figures and contraction forecasts for the economy
            etc. etc.

            Having said all that and with eyes open, Venezuela at these levels is worth a good look. We cannot ignore
            carry, willingness and its ability to pay. The last few days we have seen PDVSA making deals with Chevron,
            the Chinese, and others. That does not mean problems are solved....but is a step in the right direction.
            Here an article from The Washington Post to give more colour. Also, have a look to the PDVSA bonds runs -
            bonds have taken a hit, but has to be said that the short end is looking interesting with yields above 10%
            on PDVSA 8.50% 17, close to 12% on the PDVSA 12.75% 2022.

            As always, please let us know if you would like to discuss further.
            -.-.-.-.-.

            June 4 (Bloomberg) -- Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the state- owned oil producer, said it secured a $4.02
            billion loan from China’s Development Bank Corp. to increase production at the Sinovensa heavy oil joint
            venture in the country’s Orinoco belt.

            The agreement was signed in Beijing by PDVSA President Rafael Ramirez, Sinovensa President Erwin Hernandez
            and CDBC Vice President Wang Yongshen, the Caracas-based company known as PDVSA said yesterday in a
            statement on its website. Financing details weren’t provided.

            Chinese companies, including China National Petroleum Corp., have accords with PDVSA that aim to increase
            their portion of Venezuela’s production to as much as 1 million barrels a day by the end of 2019.

            “A key variable to watch will be whether Ramirez, who has good relations with Venezuelan President Nicolas
            Maduro, has enough power and autonomy to tweak the policy framework or grant some degree of greater autonomy
            for PDVSA’s partners to manage joint venture operations,” Daniel Kerner, director of Latin America Research
            for Eurasia Group, said in a research note to clients yesterday.

            Proceeds from the China development bank loan will be used to almost triple oil production at Sinovensa to
            330,000 barrels a day from 140,000 barrels per day, PDVSA said. The company holds a majority 64.25 percent
            stake in Sinovensa while CNPC owns the remaining 35.75 percent stake.

            Production Concerns

            PDVSA’s business plan for 2013-2019 calls for the company to increase total Venezuelan production to 6
            million barrels a day by the end of 2019, up from 2.910 million barrels at the end of 2012.

            “PDVSA has committed to using these resources exclusively towards meeting production goals, and the Maduro
            administration is clearly concerned about stagnant production,” Kerner said.

            PDVSA will allow joint ventures with CNPC and Chevron Corp. to manage $6 billion in loans designed to boost
            output, a PDVSA official said May 17. The transactions will be signed by the end of June, said the person,
            who isn’t authorized to speak publicly.

            1) Europe Shares Advance With Asian Stocks as Dollar Strengthens
            Stocks gained in Europe and Asia after a Federal Reserve official said the bank is committed to record
            stimulus. The dollar strengthened, commodities fell and Turkish shares rebounded from the biggest drop in a
            decade. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.5 percent to 300.25 at 9:36 a.m. in London, while Standard &amp;
            Poor’s 500 Index futures added less than 0.1 percent. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.9 percent as

            2) Erdogan Yields Within 1% of Record Show No Panic: Turkey Credit
            Turkey’s anti-government protests that sent the lira to a 17-month low and stocks to the biggest slump in a
            decade have left holders of longer-dated government bonds showing little sign of panic. Markets rebounded
            today after the 10-year lira yields increased 1 percentage-point since a May 2 record low to 7.15 percent
            yesterday. The yield, which was at 10 percent at ...

            Carry trades are losing the most money in a year on speculation the Federal Reserve will pare stimulus
            measures and make it harder to profit from borrowing in low-interest-rate currencies to buy higher-yielding
            assets. Deutsche Bank AG’s G10 FX Carry Basket index fell 3.3 percent last month, the biggest decline since
            May 2012, reducing its gain this year to 1.6 percent. Traders who made 2.2 ...

            Japan’s biggest stock rally in a quarter century has been fueled by earnings growth that is three times
            faster than the world average, not just speculation Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will end two decades of
            deflation. Profits for the Topix index will climb 57 percent to 74.78 yen a share in 2013, compared with the
            global average of 19 percent, according to more than 5,000 analyst forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. ...

            Recep Tayyip Erdogan predicted an early end to the unrest while the U.S. urged police restraint. A
            22-year-old man was shot dead by unidentified gunmen during an anti-government rally in the southern

            U.S. wheat farmers are enduring torrential spring rain after last year’s drought, reducing their share of
            worldwide exports to a near-record low at a time when rising global supply is driving prices into a bear
            market. Shipments will fall to 17.6 percent of global exports in the 12 months through May 2014, compared
            with 20.3 percent in 2013 and the all-time low of 17.5 percent in 2010, the ...

            headed to the nation’s mines, which have mopped up surplus workers and fueled growth for a decade. Not
            anymore. Fired by Royal Dutch Shell Plc after 26 years when the oil company shut its Sydney refinery,

            rising gasoline demand, a Bloomberg survey showed. Stockpiles dropped 650,000 barrels, or 0.2 percent, to

            seating the Chinese president next to him instead of across a table so they could talk privately. Bush
            wanted to talk about North Korea. Days later, a Chinese diplomat visited Pyongyang to push dictator Kim Jong

            that too much trading has become hidden on private venues that create more cost and volatility in public
            markets. Chief executive officers of NYSE Euronext Inc., Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. and Bats Global Markets Inc.

            costs by the most in the industry. Yields on Odebrecht’s $1.5 billion of 6.35 percent notes due in 2021 and

            20) U.K. Construction Unexpectedly Resumes Expansion on Homebuilding
            U.K. construction unexpectedly returned to growth last month, led by a surge in homebuilding. An index of

            1) Europe Shares Advance With Asian Stocks as Dollar Strengthens
            Stocks gained in Europe and Asia after a Federal Reserve official said the bank is committed to record
            stimulus. The dollar strengthened, commodities fell and Turkish shares rebounded from the biggest drop in a
            decade. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.5 percent to 300.25 at 9:36 a.m. in London, while Standard &amp;
            Poor’s 500 Index futures added less than 0.1 percent. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.9 percent as

            2) Erdogan Yields Within 1% of Record Show No Panic: Turkey Credit
            Turkey’s anti-government protests that sent the lira to a 17-month low and stocks to the biggest slump in a
            decade have left holders of longer-dated government bonds showing little sign of panic. Markets rebounded
            today after the 10-year lira yields increased 1 percentage-point since a May 2 record low to 7.15 percent
            yesterday. The yield, which was at 10 percent at ...

            3) Spain Rebounding From Worst Economy as Exports Transform Country
            Victor Alberola Salcedo was shocked when the construction of a suburban Madrid train line was halted in
            2010, terminating a contract for his 17-person company. It brought home the reality of the worst economy in
            his country’s more than 30 years of democracy. Government investment had been the last hope for Alberola’s
            Voxelstudios, which produced promotional videos to help ...

            4) Carry Traders Fall Victim to Bernanke Tapering Wager: Currencies
            Carry trades are losing the most money in a year on speculation the Federal Reserve will pare stimulus
            measures and make it harder to profit from borrowing in low-interest-rate currencies to buy higher-yielding
            assets. Deutsche Bank AG’s G10 FX Carry Basket index fell 3.3 percent last month, the biggest decline since
            May 2012, reducing its gain this year to 1.6 percent. Traders who made 2.2 ...

            5) Topix Profit Tripling Global Growth Even in $400 Billion Wipeout
            Japan’s biggest stock rally in a quarter century has been fueled by earnings growth that is three times
            faster than the world average, not just speculation Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will end two decades of
            deflation. Profits for the Topix index will climb 57 percent to 74.78 yen a share in 2013, compared with the
            global average of 19 percent, according to more than 5,000 analyst forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. ...

            6) Turkey Clashes Persist as Erdogan Predicts Early End to Protest
            Turkish demonstrators clashed with police overnight and a second protester was killed, as Prime Minister
            Recep Tayyip Erdogan predicted an early end to the unrest while the U.S. urged police restraint. A
            22-year-old man was shot dead by unidentified gunmen during an anti-government rally in the southern
            province of Hatay, local Governor Mehmet Celalettin Lekesiz said. One person had been killed in Istanbul on

            Floodwaters that inundated Prague and swamped large areas of central Europe may peak today as emergency
            crews work to open river traffic, drain submerged neighborhoods and count the cost of the storm damage.
            Chancellor Angela Merkel will begin a tour of flooded regions in Germany this morning after forecasters

            8) Xi-Obama Summit to Build Rapport as North Korea Beats Yuan
            In April 2006, President George W. Bush rearranged the name cards at a White House lunch with Hu Jintao,
            seating the Chinese president next to him instead of across a table so they could talk privately. Bush
            wanted to talk about North Korea. Days later, a Chinese diplomat visited Pyongyang to push dictator Kim Jong
            Il to return to nuclear talks. Within a year, the North agreed to shut down a ...

            U.S. crude supplies probably fell from an 82-year high as refineries bolstered fuel production to meet
            rising gasoline demand, a Bloomberg survey showed. Stockpiles dropped 650,000 barrels, or 0.2 percent, to
            396.9 million in the seven days ended May 31, based on the median of 10 analyst estimates before an Energy
            Information Administration report tomorrow. Seven respondents forecast a decrease and ...

            10) Dark Pool Curbs Sought by U.S. Exchanges Fighting Trading Exodus
            Three large U.S. stock exchanges are lobbying for new limits on dark pools and other competitors, arguing
            that too much trading has become hidden on private venues that create more cost and volatility in public
            markets. Chief executive officers of NYSE Euronext Inc., Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. and Bats Global Markets Inc.
            have met in Washington over the past two months with lawmakers and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

            The yen weakened for the first time in three days against the euro as Asian and European stocks gained amid
            waning speculation the Federal Reserve will reduce monetary stimulus. Japan’s currency depreciated beyond
            100 per dollar after climbing to the strongest in three weeks yesterday. Australia’s dollar declined versus
            all of its 16 major counterparts after the Reserve Bank said the inflation outlook provided some scope for
            further monetary easing. ...

            West Texas Intermediate crude fell after the biggest gain in a month, amid forecasts that inventories of
            gasoline expanded last week in the U.S., the world’s largest oil consumer. Futures retreated as much as 0.7
            percent in New York. Gasoline stockpiles probably climbed by 1.2 million barrels last week, while distillate

            15) Losing Revenue From Hybrids Prompts States to Hit Owners: Taxes
            Hybrid and electric cars are sparing the environment. Critics say they’re hurting the roads. The popularity
            of these fuel-efficient vehicles is being blamed for a drop in gasoline taxes that pay for local highway and
            bridge maintenance, with three states enacting rules to make up the losses with added fees on the cars and
            at least five others weighing similar legislation. “The intent is that people who use the roads pay for
            them,” said ...

            Business is booming at Pioneer Natural Resources Co., an oil and gas exploration company, and so is its
            demand for pickups. Pioneer bought more than 250 new Ford F-Series trucks since August and is ordering 200
            more. “We’re definitely going through a growth period,” said Lynn Lyon, the Pioneer executive in charge of
            purchasing the trucks and converting them to run on the natural gas Pioneer extracts by fracking rich ...

            Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta, seeking to build on his predecessor’s efforts to keep the country out
            of the European debt crisis, still has a way to go when it comes to convincing investors. Spanish bonds have
            outperformed Italian peers since an inconclusive election led to two months of political gridlock. While

            Carnival Corp. is dealing creditors the only losses among U.S. leisure and entertainment companies this year
            as at least five mishaps on its ships since January 2012 compel the world’s largest cruise operator to offer
            discounts and threatens to reduce annual profit to a decade-low. Bonds sold by Carnival have lost 0.04

            U.S. Treasuries fell amid speculation the Federal Reserve will reduce its bond purchases as data that is
            forecast to show companies hired more workers adds to evidence the recovery is strengthening. The extra
            yield, or spread, that investors get for holding 10-year Treasuries instead of similar-maturity Japanese
            bonds was four basis points from a two-month high. U.S. companies stepped up hiring last month more than
            they did in April, ...

            as the worst monthly rout in emerging-market corporate debt in 20 months pushes up the company’s borrowing
            costs by the most in the industry. Yields on Odebrecht’s $1.5 billion of 6.35 percent notes due in 2021 and

            U.S. stock futures were little changed, after the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index rebounded from a
            three-week low yesterday, as investors awaited further signals on whether the Federal Reserve will pare bond

            worldwide exports to a near-record low at a time when rising global supply is driving prices into a bear

            1) Europe Shares Advance With Asian Stocks as Dollar Strengthens
            Stocks gained in Europe and Asia after a Federal Reserve official said the bank is committed to record
            stimulus. The dollar strengthened, commodities fell and Turkish shares rebounded from the biggest drop in a
            decade. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.5 percent to 300.25 at 9:36 a.m. in London, while Standard &amp;
            Poor’s 500 Index futures added less than 0.1 percent. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.9 percent as

            Turkey’s anti-government protests that sent the lira to a 17-month low and stocks to the biggest slump in a
            decade have left holders of longer-dated government bonds showing little sign of panic. Markets rebounded
            today after the 10-year lira yields increased 1 percentage-point since a May 2 record low to 7.15 percent

            faster than the world average, not just speculation Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will end two decades of
            deflation. Profits for the Topix index will climb 57 percent to 74.78 yen a share in 2013, compared with the
            global average of 19 percent, according to more than 5,000 analyst forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. ...

            U.S. wheat farmers are enduring torrential spring rain after last year’s drought, reducing their share of
            worldwide exports to a near-record low at a time when rising global supply is driving prices into a bear
            market. Shipments will fall to 17.6 percent of global exports in the 12 months through May 2014, compared

            14) WSJ [Reg]: New York Giants sign WR Keith Carlos
            EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — The New York Giants have signed wide receiver Keith Carlos. The Giants announced the
            signing on Monday. A spot on their roster opened after running back Jeremy Wright was waived Friday. Carlos
            was briefly with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2011, but has no professional playing experience. Carlos played
            at Purdue in 2009 and 2010, first as a wide receiver and then a running back. In his first season, he caught
            21 passes for 242 yards and a touchdown and returned five kickoffs for ...

            CEEMEA FX and Rates Strategy Daily - 4 June 2013
        </Subject>
        <MsgBody>
            TRY
            Bonds opened slightly in the positive territory at the super illiquid market. Trading activity is very
            limited. Locals are generally bearish and they prefer to stay sideways. That said, we are seeing a few
            offshore enquiries, after so much noise over the past trading session. Central Bank’s modus operandi in the
            repo auction remains unchanged, but Lira attempts at a rebound nevertheless.

            HUF
            Some pullback on rates after the selloff of the past few days but volumes remain fairly low as the curve
            manages to squeeze lower, partially helped by the rebound of HUF and the weak HU PMI. Curve steepened
            slightly in 2v5 swaps and flattened a 1 bp in 5v10. We have seen some interest to receive in the front-end
            of the curve, given the aggressive repricing on the market implied policy rate cuts over the past 2 weeks.
            We believe 2v5s has some upside room now. Bonds behaved in a similar fashion and the curve flattened a
            little as the front end remained offered and local buyers emerged at the back end of the curve. No domestic
            data today. We will have the conference call with the government’s economic advisor (Gyorgy Barcza) this
            afternoon. A nice checkpoint to assess what could be the pipeline of new economic measures in the medium
            term.

            On the policy front, the government continues to push for further utility price cuts. This time around, the
            parliament approved another 10% gas prices (bottled gap), to be effective on 1 July. The government is also
            planning an additional cut in utility prices by the autumn. All in all, it is difficult to see any big
            rebound in Hungarian CPI, given the highly deflationary environment. The background still gives ample room
            for a couple of cuts more in the policy rates, at least.


            ZAR
            Bond yields declined as the ZAR strengthened yesterday. The PMI for May was recorded at 50.4 vs. 49.9
            expected and 50.5 previously. Although the overall number was relatively flat, the individual components
            showed mixed results. New sales orders fell to 51.1 (declining 2.6 points) and business activity fell to
            50.6 (a decline of 1.6 points) however the overall number benefitted from increases in the inventory and
            employment components. Price pressures remain evident as the price index rose to 82.4 (a rise of 4.4
            points). New vehicle sales came in at 7.5% for May 2013 against 5.8% expected and 19.5% previously, notably
            new vehicle exports sales performance was strong (a 16.5% increase in volume).
            Auction today: 800mm R213; 800mm R209; 750mm R2048.


            RUB
            Manufacturing growth expanded at its weakest pace in five months in May, as output was close to stagnating
            due to weaker new orders, a survey showed on Monday. Russia&apos;s HSBC purchasing managers&apos; index
            (PMI) fell to 50.4 in May from 50.6 in the previous month. It is not the dominant industry in the Russian
            economy (as it accounts for only 16% of the Russian economy) but it gives investors a glimpse of the general
            estate of the Russian economy, which is also struggling with some deceleration in oil output.
            Account balances went below RUB 900bn, so today probably we won’t see rates falling below 6% in the
            afternoon. REPO limit capped at RUB 430bn, so overall REPO offering is close to all collateral bank
            currently hold. At open see o/n 6.25 / 6.40, swaps slightly better bid at 6.46% mid.

            ILS
            Bonds open almost flat from yesterday&apos;s close. Over the past 10 days bonds have sold-off over 30bps,
            erasing all the gains of April and some of March. We believe the front end is still receive as it is
            anchored to the USDILS whilst we view the back end as quite risky considering its greater correlation to
            USTs.

            CEEMEA Options
            USDZAR options: spot is coming lower but with such ferocity that people need the gamma so 1M paid at 17.5 as
            short date contract untradeable at this point

            Other than front end ZAR all CEEMEA vols look softer today with the retracement in spot, very little trading
            as people reluctant to get given anything at these levels. 1m USDRUB down 0.4, 6m USDTRY down 0.4 from last
            night indicative of the price action

            Chile | Minutes confirm dovish tone and have explicit easing bias

            Mexico | Monthly Survey of Expectations – Inflation higher, Growth weaker

            Peru | Growth and inflation allow monetary easing


            Chile | Minutes confirm dovish tone and have explicit easing bias. According to the minutes from the last
            monetary policy meeting the central bank weighted the possibility of cutting the benchmark interest rate by
            25bps in May. Officials noted lower interest rates would be consistent with evidence of weaker domestic
            demand and economic growth in the first quarter and downside risks from lower copper prices and decelerating
            economic activity in emerging markets. Interest rate cuts would also be consistent with low headline and
            core inflation and well anchored inflation expectations. Some of the members of the board also said lower
            interest rates would also allow adjusting for relative tighter monetary conditions when considering real
            interest rates and interest rate cuts by other central banks in emerging markets and the developed world. In
            the end the central bank unanimously decided to keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged and wait for more
            information to confirm weaker growth and low and stable inflation before cutting rates. The central bank
            remains cautious, as consumption growth remains high and keeps strong positive momentum. Evidence of still
            tight labor market conditions and the widening current account deficit also supported the decision. We
            expect inflation to remain low and domestic demand and economic growth to further moderate this year and the
            central bank to cut the benchmark interest rate before the end of 2013. New numbers on economic activity and
            salaries on Thursday and inflation on Friday this week should provide important information, but we believe
            the central bank is still likely to keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 5% in the next monetary
            policy meeting on June 13 and wait at least until the next meeting before making an adjustment. We expect
            the quarterly monetary policy report (Ipom) scheduled to be released later this month to have a clear easing
            bias. We still like receiving rates and maintain our initial receiver position on two-year CLP-Camara rates
            (RBS, Chile | Timing the easing cycle, May 7). [Felipe Hernandez]

            Mexico | Monthly Survey of Expectations – Inflation higher, Growth weaker. Banxico updated its monthly
            survey of private sector expectations for May. There were telling changes were for inflation and growth.
            Inflation expectations were broadly higher including the longer term. Expectations for inflation in 2013
            moved to 3.93% p.a. from 3.90% p.a. in the April survey. For 2014, inflation expectations were revised to
            3.80% p.a. from 3.77% p.a. in April. Economists in Mexico still expect inflation to peak in May, but at a
            higher level of 4.66% p.a versus 4.57% p.a. the April survey. Notably, the recovery in inflation back
            towards December isn’t as shallow as it was in the previous monthly results, though expectations are still
            that inflation comes back up above 4.0% p.a. early next year. There is likely some component of the reform
            outlook in these forecasts, primarily the fiscal reform which could initially lift prices through lower
            subsidies and higher taxes. However, though price pressures from fiscal reforms can be immediate, they are
            generally temporary and have the potential to positively impact growth potential. This would indicate higher
            non-inflationary growth especially in 2015. Yet, GDP growth forecasts were revised considerably lower for
            2013 from 3.35% to 2.96% and only slightly raised from 3.96% to 3.98% for 2014. In spite of the reform story
            in Mexico, economists still see average GDP growth below 4% for the next 10 years. So while the market is
            sufficiently optimistic on the reform agenda, this does not yet translate into higher growth, lower
            inflation potential. In terms of policy rates expectations, the May survey priced in a small reduction in
            policy rates in mid-Q3, though we should be cognizant that the collection period for the survey missed the
            bulk of the USDMXN spike and the back up in US rates. The 75bp spread widening between MXN and US 10Y rates
            is reversing some of the relative tightening in monetary conditions that prompted Banxico to cut rates by
            50bp last month. Combined with a weaker peso, the probability that Banxico does another -50bp at this time
            is lower. We still believe that the most probable direction for the next move in interest rates is down and
            not up, but there needs to be more significant improvement in inflation before that actually happens, even
            more so now with USDMXN at these levels. We expect no change therefore in the O/N rate this Friday. We
            expect Banxico to maintain a dovish bias however in order to manage expectations especially where economic
            growth is concerned. [Flavia Cattan-Naslausky]

            Peru | Growth and inflation allow monetary easing. We estimate leading indicators released last week are
            consistent with the monthly economic activity index rising between 5 % and 5.5% y/y in April. Our forecast
            compares with growth of 3% in March and the long-term trend of 6% and implies average growth in the first
            four months of the year would fall to close to 4.8% from 5.7% one year before. The result is in line with
            our forecast for still positive but more moderate domestic demand and economic activity in 2013. The
            official monthly economic activity index is scheduled to be released on June 14. Leading indicators show
            utilities maintained their positive trend and climbed 7% when compared with the year before. Cement sales
            had a strong rebound and jumped 24% over the same period. Figures also show higher public sector spending
            and credit growth and support expectations for higher growth in April. The higher number of working days
            when compared with the year before should also contribute. Agriculture kept positive growth but decelerated
            while fishing kept falling albeit at a more moderate rate than before. Preliminary export revenues also
            extended their negative trend dragged by lower commodity prices and weak external demand. Preliminary
            figures also show higher imports and are consistent with stronger domestic demand during the month. The
            consumer price index increased 0.19% m/m in May. The result was higher than the market consensus forecast of
            0.15% according to Bloomberg and mainly explained by supply shocks on food prices. Annual inflation climbed
            to 2.46% from 2.31% in the previous month, but remains below 4.14% one year before and the ceiling of the
            inflation target of 2% +/- one percentage point. Inflation excluding food prices fell to 1.99% dragged down
            by lower utility tariffs and gasoline prices regulated by the government. Inflation of tradable goods
            extended the down trend from the previous month and fell to 1.51% in May despite sharp exchange rate
            depreciation during the month. Inflation of non-tradable goods fell to 3.5% from 3.53% in the previous month
            and 3.77% one year before. We expect the central bank to keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4.25%
            in the next monetary policy meeting on June 13 and in the near-term, but expect it to gradually shift to a
            more dovish tone and possibly cut interest rates if as we expect we see evidence of further deceleration and
            no evidence of pressure on prices. [Felipe Hernandez]

            JGBs opened weaker and continued to grind lower into the 10yr auction. Results of the 10yr auction were a
            touch weaker than expected with the market selling off more post the auction. Dip buyers did emerge though
            keeping yields sub 90bps. The back-end though didn’t see dip buying emerge and instead continued to weaken
            as RM put on steepeners and dealers hedged ahead of Thursday’s 30yr auction. 30yrs finished the day off 8bps
            with 7-10yrs off 5bps. The NIK saw the 2nd largest intraday rally of the year (560pts from low to high) with
            the index finishing up 2.05% (Banks +7.25%). The RBA left rates unchanged at 2.75% as expected. Activity
            pre-RBA was rather muted. Post the release there was a rather orderly sell off in bonds of 3-4bps. Into
            London a better than expected Spanish Unemployment Number (-98.3k vs -50k expec) has put Bunds on the back
            foot. 10k Bunds traded on the break of 143.26 with the market trading down to 143.13 before bouncing
            quickly. Bobls are underperforming this AM ahead of tomorrow’s 4bn re-opening. UK PMI Construction came in
            at 50.8 vs 49.8 expec and 49.4 prior. The PMI Construction is the most important variable in our UK CAI,
            which now stands at 1.1% in May. For today we get the Trade Balance. We will hear from Raskin at 12:30,
            George at 2:15, and Fisher at 8pm. The Fed is buying 2.75-3.5bn 8/20-5/23s. Thank you and good luck - JC

            Top Headlines

            • Market Update – a night of mixed trading and no news. This remains a market filled more w/noise than news
            and despite plenty of headlines it’s increasingly difficult to find a whole lot of incremental information
            each morning. Japan’s Nikkei rebounded 2.05% Tues (enjoying its biggest one-day advance since Wed 5/15),
            spurred higher by reports of the Abe government overhauling the nation’s pensions and raising equity
            allocations (this first made its way into the press last week although was picked up again late in NY
            trading Mon in both the Nikkei http://goo.gl/DtlEA and on Reuters http://goo.gl/jz7Gq). Abe hopes to
            mobilize Japan’s massive savings hoard by encouraging investors to allocate out of fixed income and into
            risker assets (namely stocks) as part of a bid to boost growth and consumption (note that Abe will be
            delivering a speech Wed outlining the 3rd prong of &quot;Abenomics� and is expected to touch on this
            pensions idea). The Japanese strength was broad although financials/REITs in particular surged (financials
            jumped &gt;6%) while tech, telecom, and consumer goods all performed well too. The yen rallied all the way
            to sub 99 late Mon night although has since weakened and is back above 100 vs. the US$. Japanese 10yr yields
            remain very volatile and jumped 6bp overnight (to 87bp) as investors anticipate selling pressure by
            pensions. China’s Shanghai slumped 1.17% overnight, its 4th consecutive decline, following a relatively
            quiet session of news. Some vague reports pointing to stiffer Beijing property curbs were picked up by the
            wires to explain China’s softness but this sounds more like an excuse than anything else. The next big
            catalyst for China will come this weekend when a ton of May eco data hits (inc. CPI/PPI, IP, FAI, retail
            sales, trade, etc). Turning to Europe, stocks are enjoying mild gains but like most other major geographies
            there really wasn’t a lot of major news out in the last 12 hours. The Continent is facing two big policy
            decisions (bank union and SME lending) – on the former it sounds like officials are working on a broad
            framework that could include an FDIC-like pan-European bank insurance scheme (per the FT
            http://goo.gl/bXRGA) although the SME lending measures will likely underwhelm investors (a separate FT
            article says the ECB is backing away from a &quot;bazooka�-backed SME lending program http://goo.gl/ixLXL
            and JPM’s G Fuzesi doesn’t think Darghi will unveil any major policy changes this Thurs
            http://goo.gl/uluOC). Stepping back and looking at the market’s big picture, the broader narrative has been
            static for a couple weeks now. The &quot;tapering� campaign, which kicked off earlier in May, has helped
            evolve market expectations to the point where the consensus is now roughly circling Sept 18 as the date on
            which a formal Fed announcement could take place (this really hasn’t changed despite all the Fed rhetoric
            and Mon’s somewhat subdued data. Lockhart was ostensibly responsible for every tick in the S&amp;P Mon
            according to the major news wires but reading through his actual remarks reveals a message remarkably
            similar to the ones delivered by other Fed officials lately: the FOMC is watching data very closely and if
            the present trends stays in place then Sept looks likely for a formal taper. On the data front, the
            manufacturing ISMs globally inched up slightly M/M and while there were discrepancies between the official
            government and Markit/HSBC readings overall it appears that May wasn’t all that different from Apr). Looking
            into the US, it will prob. be another quiet trading session. Two of the Fed’s biggest hawks are scheduled to
            deliver remarks (George at 2:15pmET and Fisher at 8pmET) and will prob. call for earlier tapering but
            investors shouldn’t lose sight of the broader FOMC message (articulated by Bernanke/Yellen/Dudley/Williams –
            policy is very data dependent and assuming everything stays the way it is now then 9/18 will be a crucial
            date).

            Europe

            • ECB preview from JPM’s G Fuzesi - the ECB is not expected to announce any policy changes on Thursday. The
            business surveys increased in May and hence the probability of a rate cut is low, in our view. Meaningful
            action on SMEs is also pretty unlikely. In terms of tone, Draghi will try to balance two messages. He will
            try to sound constructive about the economy (to justify the lack of policy action) and to also leave the
            door open to further policy easing (to talk down market rates). How effective the latter will be is unclear,
            for example in light of the skepticism expressed recently by many Governing Council members about a negative
            deposit rate. Regarding growth and inflation, the ECB staff will present their new forecasts this week. We
            expect both to be revised down slightly. http://goo.gl/uluOC

            • ECB not planning &quot;big bazooka&quot; response for SME lending according to the FT - &quot;the ECB’s
            review of the problem suggests that the blockage in lending remains weakened bank balance sheets and would
            not warrant direct intervention in the SME borrowing process by the central bank&quot; - FT
            (http://goo.gl/ixLXL). This article reads negatively although keep in mind that expectations were never
            super high when it comes to some magic SME lending bullet. The ECB was always going to have a much easier
            time convincing the world of the euro’s viability (which it did via the OMT) vs. fully unglogging the
            transmission mechanism.

            • European bank resolution proposal – according to the FT, European officials will propose sweeping new
            powers for bank resolution, potentially setting the stage for a clash w/Berlin. The resolution proposal
            would centralize powers at the EC in Brussels, giving Europe the ability to wind-down failed banks and
            overrule local governments. In addition, the proposal would centralize the current system of state bank
            resolution funds - &quot;this (resolution fund centralization) would provide substantial synergies and
            enhance financial stability, compared to a mere network of national resolution funds, by pooling resources
            from and for all participating banks�. Germany has long resisted centralizing bank resolution, arguing that
            such a move would require the changing of EU treaties. http://goo.gl/bXRGA

            • Spain – joblessness fell 98.3K people in May, better than the St forecast (which looked for a 50K
            decline). The data was seized upon by the Rajoy government as a sign of stability in the Spanish economy.
            &quot;It&apos;s the best data we&apos;ve seen since the crisis began,&quot; Industry Minister Jose Manuel
            Soria said at a conference on Tuesday. Reuters

            • Portugal&apos;s UGT labour union said on Monday it will take part in a general strike called for June 27
            (Reuters)

            • STM - chief executive Carlo Bozotti told Le Figaro newspaper it expects growth of 5 to 10 percent this
            year after a 5 percent increase in the first quarter – Reuters

            • UBS - the co said it isn&apos;t looking to split off the IB into a separate business. UBS will look to
            more closely align the IB w/the core wealth mgmt. business - Reuters

            • Wolseley&apos;s Q3 performance is broadly in-line with our expectations. On first take, we expect no
            material changes to consensus forecasts (Emily Biddulph http://goo.gl/aCKr0).

            Asia/Emerging Markets

            • Japan - the BOJ will consider extending the term of low-interest lending to banks during next week&apos;s
            meeting. Right now the BOJ offers banks funds fixed at 0.1% for up to one year - the BOJ could extend the
            term of those loans to two years in an effort to curb bond market volatility. &quot;Some in the central bank
            are concerned that boosting long-term low-interest loans to financial institutions and urging them to buy
            JGBs could undermine the BOJ&apos;s another goal of guiding their money toward risk assets, such as stocks
            and lending�. Nikkei http://goo.gl/vJsvt

            • Japanese pension update in the Nikkei - the Japanese gov&apos;t will revamp the investment strategies of
            its pensions, &quot;partly by including more stocks by the end of fiscal 2015 in a shift away from the
            current emphasis on bonds� - &quot;Overhauling GPIF&apos;s asset structure will be a major focal point.
            Stock investments now account for around 20% of its assets, far below the average 38% weighting in 10 major
            public pension programs around the world such as Norway&apos;s�. Nikkei (http://goo.gl/DtlEA).

            • Japan – Reuters talks about how the Abe government will look to mobilize Japan’s massive savings hoard in
            order to boost growth.� Abe will look to reduce the country’s pension allocation towards Japanese government
            bonds and more towards stocks.� Reuters� � http://goo.gl/jz7Gq� �

            • Japan – WSJ recaps the recent Nikkei action; nothing really incremental in the article but attributes the
            YTD surge in the Nikkei largely to &quot;hot money� hedge funds chasing &quot;Abenomics� hopes.� Many
            traders were long Japanese stocks and short the yen, amplifying both the upside and downside potential.� The
            article suggests Japanese trust banks began selling stocks late in May to rebalance their portfolios and
            that initial weakness sparked HFs to run for the exits.� WSJ� � http://goo.gl/TlvSa� �

            • Japanese wages - total monthly wages rose 0.3%oya with the first increase in the core scheduled earning
            since May last year. But, it is probably too early to judge that the soft trend of wages changed from the
            beginning of this year. The core wages likely will stay subdued, but Summer bonuses are expected to be
            raised much with solid corporate profits and government campaign. Adachi http://goo.gl/P1JUn

            • China housing – the city of Beijing is being forced to adopt more stringent real estate curbs given the
            ongoing strength in housing prices. &quot;Local officials will need further tightening as they struggle to
            meet this year’s target of keeping prices unchanged from last year�. Bloomberg

            • China will ask all interbank bond market participants to settle bond trades by the delivery versus payment
            method to close loopholes – Bloomberg

            • China – the country will adopt measures designed to restore confidence to the powder milk industry –
            Bloomberg

            • Australia - the RBA Board today decided to leave the cash rate steady at 2.75% as we and the majority of
            market economists had anticipated. Walters http://goo.gl/ZeQ9m

            POLAND LOCAL: Market waiting for MPC tomorrow
        </Subject>
        <MsgBody>
            Bonds opening stronger with local buying interest but core markets sell off holding further gains. Market is
            waiting for MPC tomorrow (25bp cut priced in) and auction of 5y bonds on Thursday (up to 6yrds of bonds).

            I am using spikes to reduce my bond holdings, also see good risk reward in paying FRA as we already pricing
            75bp in next 3 meetings.

            PS0418 103.25-35 (+10 cents)
            DS1023 104.25-45 (+20 cents)

            2y 2.60-63 (-3bp)
            5y 2.96-99 (-3bp)
            10y 3.34-37 (-3bp)

            FX: With sentiment slightly better across the board and EURUSD looking like it wants to flirt with 1.31
            zloty is touch stronger as well. EURPLN slides to 4.2300 (vs. 4.2560/00 open), USDPLN to 3.2320. Market
            still feels bit heavy, guess longs opened around 4.25-4.26 not feeling very comfortable. We could slide
            further for market to get cleaned before considering buying dips. 4.2100 EURPLN looks like solid support.
            MPC starts two day meeting today, market expects 25bp cut tomorrow and 25bp in July. Base rate now 3%.

            Spot ref: EURPLN 4.2440, USDPLN 3.2450

            NIGERIA LOCAL: tbill auction tomorrow. NGN spot stable
        </Subject>
        <MsgBody>
            Been quite a bit of sell off both in the bonds and t-bills space in the last couple of days. The T-bills
            auction comes up tomorrow and will definitely give some indication to the direction of yields in the short
            term. On offer are N22.97bn, N30bn and N85bn of the 91 182 and 364 day bills. Expectations are between
            11.15-35 for 91 days, 11.80-12% for the 182 days and 11.95-12.25 for the 364 days.

            In fx, NGN now 158.19/29. After trading sharply lower on Friday on rumors of impending foreign investors&apos;
            sell-off of Nigerian securities, which later proved to be untrue, the USDNGN was stable on the interbank
            market yesterday. It closed at 158.28, a bit higher than Friday&apos;s 158.15. The local currency was helped
            by sale of the US dollars by some multinational oil companies this week and the central bank&apos;s
            intervention on Friday to quell the pressure. We expect the currency pair will trade flat this week and
            possibly close lower when, and if, the state-owned NNPC sells its usual month-end USD300-400mn.

            T-bill run:

            TURKEY LOCAL: Bonds down 20bp on offshore demand in illiquid mkt
        </Subject>
        <MsgBody>
            Bonds opened slightly in the positive territory in a super illiquid market. Trading activity is very
            limited. Locals are generally bearish and they prefer to stay sideways. That said, we are seeing a few
            offshore inquiries, after so much noise over the past trading session. Central Bank’s modus operandi in the
            repo auction remains unchanged, but Lira attempts at a rebound nevertheless.

            More steepening in swaps after ARINC statements, as market calms down. CBT didn’t affect the liquidity, so
            we are expecting a more aggressive correction in short end. Bear in mind end of June will probably see fx
            swaps thru the floor again as (local banks need to report higher FX reserves) unless social unrest will
            escalate again.

            please see attached report

            • The central bank debate has shifted on the prospects of monetary easing, dependent upon confirmation of a
            slowdown in domestic demand.
            • This supports our recommendation of long positions in local bonds with long position in USDCLP. The
            intensity of the recent FX weakness may subside, but policy bias still favors FX weakness.

            CHILE | INDIRECT BIAS FOR FX WEAKNESS
            It has been an early phase of de-leveraging with local markets most at risk for crowded long positions after
            attracting the majority of the QE cycle inflows. The central banks have been tolerant of FX weakness which
            further encouraged the intensity of the selloff. Chile may not be as vulnerable on positioning or
            de-leveraging risk, but there is a clear policy bias that encourages FX weakness. The opening sentence to
            the latest minutes was that the relevant options for the central bank was to either keep the policy rate
            unchanged at 5.0% or to lower it by 25bp to 4.75%. We have often argued that the ideal policy response for a
            two speed economy of strong domestic demand and weak external demand is to favor FX versus monetary
            stimulus. There has already been a more dovish policy shift towards verbal intervention from central bank
            officials. The central bank has been mostly paralyzed on monetary policy on these competing forces of weak
            external demand and strong domestic demand, but is now reacting to weak headline growth and a faster than
            expected deceleration in domestic demand (more so investment as opposed to consumption). There were a few
            board members that adopted a cautious tone to confirm the broader deceleration but a consensus view on
            downside risks to growth.

            We infer an implicit monetary easing bias but dependent upon a slowdown in consumer demand. It is unusual
            that there was no direct reference to the FX rate in terms of competitiveness constraints or misalignments
            to fundamentals other than concerns of the increasing external imbalance. There was notable reference on how
            central banks have been relying upon monetary easing as an indirect approach for FX weakness to explicitly
            or implicitly address FX misalignments. The one-off rate cut (similar to Mexico) may offer a more cost
            effective alternative to direct FX intervention. We would not rule out that officials continue to threaten
            monetary stimulus to purposely weaken the FX and avoid more costly direct intervention.

            The central bank may wait for confirmation of a broader slowdown before initiating a rate cut cycle; however
            the monetary easing bias supports a strategy for FX weakness. The Chile central bank is keenly aware of
            external trends, and is also likely monitoring the shift in growth expectations of lower commodity prices, a
            stronger USD and the rotation trade out of emerging markets and back to US markets. The latest round of
            quantitative easing from Japan is also a critical risk factor with Japan an important trading partner and
            Asia more than 1/3 of trade flows.

            We have been recommending long positions in CLP’20 with a short position in USDCLP (over hedge to target FX
            weakness) to maximize potential FX gains with the optionality of lower yields. (For more details please see,
            “Chile | shifting dovish,” published 17 May 2013 and “Chile | finally ready to act?,” published 9 May 2013).
            The long bond position would provide optionality of monetary easing or at least anchor the long end of the
            curve against UST contagion. There has already been a pronounced underperformance of the offshore CLP’20 for
            the reduction in the onshore/offshore risk premium earlier this year. This suggests a better technical
            position of the offshore Global FX bond, no longer so expensive on relative terms and still an attractive
            proxy for onshore exposure on the illiquid/infant GDN market. The onshore BTP bonds have begun to rally on
            the prospects of monetary easing. It is notable that country specific risk drivers have been more dominant
            on local bond markets, with no obvious signs of UST contagion as the interest rate curve remains more
            sensitive to the interest rate policy risk. There are no official data to validate the stock of foreign
            holdings. We assume that the administrative barriers to entry likely slowed the speculative capital inflows
            into the fixed income debt stock. It may not be the crowded positioning as the culprit for FX weakness but
            rather the policy risk that favors FX intervention and the small, open economy that remains vulnerable to
            the adverse trends of lower commodity prices and still weak external demand. This suggests that on this
            initial phase of de-leveraging that USDCLP may not be the first to recover, especially if policy officials
            continue to debate the prospects for monetary stimulus with indirect risk for FX weakness. It is notable
            that USDCLP and USDCOP have de-coupled on the incipient strength across other LatAm FX on a clear policy
            bias that favors FX weakness.

            outperformed yesterday--24s, 25s and 27s, boosted by a strong local bid. For
            anyone looking to reduce rate rate exposure, 17s and new 19s look cheap on the
            curve. We are axed buyers of 34s this morning.

            Bond yields declined as the ZAR strengthened yesterday and today. Trading volumes very light today.

            Auction today: 800mm R213; 800mm R209; 750mm R2048.
            Very poor results in the r209s, mids in the r213 and r2048

            IRS Yields firmer on stronger ZAR. Better receivers seen - market very thin.

            Yesterday the PMI for May was recorded at 50.4 vs. 49.9 expected and 50.5 previously. Although the overall
            number was relatively flat, the individual components showed mixed results. New sales orders fell to 51.1
            (declining 2.6 points) and business activity fell to 50.6 (a decline of 1.6 points) however the overall
            number benefitted from increases in the inventory and employment components. Price pressures remain evident
            as the price index rose to 82.4 (a rise of 4.4 points). New vehicle sales came in at 7.5% for May 2013
            against 5.8% expected and 19.5% previously, notably new vehicle exports sales performance was strong (a
            16.5% increase in volume).

            Most rally was locally driven, seeing moderate international inflow. Overall the move was significant for
            single day, so should consolidate at current levels. The market is very quiet last few hours.

            Overview

            A quiet London morning, with the dollar trading mixed and commodity
            currencies underperforming. Overnight, Asian equities were mixed with
            China stocks disappointing (Shangcomp -1.15%) although the Nikkei (+2.05%)
            bounced, helped by the news that Japan will pressure pension funds to
            allocate more funds to domestic stocks (see below). USD/Asia was mostly
            lower, with KRW outperforming, USD/KRW (spot) opening 8.4 won lower at
            1119.80 and the moves helped by China continuing to fix lower, making a
            new record low of 6.1735 (-71pips). The RBA (see below) was a non-event
            and AUD/USD has ground steadily lower during London hours, mostly
            reversing yesterday&apos;s move, reaching 0.9651. The dollar has also moved
            higher against most of the rest of G10. USD/JPY has climbed back about 100
            to 100.40. EUR has bucked this trend, and EUR/USD has made a high of
            1.3095. European equities are modestly stronger (Eurostoxx +0.29%) and
            bund yields are close to touching yesterday&apos;s highs. In EMEA, there has
            been a substantially rally in rates in ZAR, HUF, PLN and TRY. This has
            been helped by the currencies establishing recoveries. USD/ZAR has dropped
            15.23 big figures to 9.6606. TRY is also stronger with markets a little
            calmer over Turkey protests. Heading into New York, S&amp;P futures are flat
            (+0.02%).

            Detailed News

            Finland&apos;s Prime Minister Jyrki Katainen said that he did not think the ECB
            could should conduct further easing and that negative rates would not help
            credit growth in the Euro Area. The comments came after a story from the
            FT reported that the ECB thinks there is little unconventional monetary
            policy can do to boost bank lending. Moreover, the ECB are still focused
            on the Asset Quality Review for European banks ahead of taking over
            supervision mid-2014. DB FX strategist George Saravelos noted that
            regulatory pressure on banks will remain and the extent of capital
            shortfall will remain imparing credit transmission in the Euro Area.

            The IMF have cut its growth forecasts for France, with GDP seen to
            contract in 2013 by -0.2% now versus -0.1% previously and growth by 0.8%
            in 2014 against a previous forecast of 0.9%. In the organization&apos;s report
            on France, it said the country must step up reforms to liberalize its
            economy and lower labour costs, but on the demand side of the equation it
            was also important for the country to moderate the pace of budget
            consolidation.

            Bank of England Financial Policy Committee (FPC) member Tim Taylor said he
            hoped the FPC will not &apos;continually reopen&apos; the question of bank capital
            in the UK. DB FX strategist George Saravelos noted that the FPC had
            published a report earlier in the year showing that UK banks had a capital
            shortfall of roughly GBP 25bn in meeting Basel III regulatory
            requirements. The comments suggested that UK banks may be drawing to the
            end of their asset disposal process.

            UK BRC sales were better than expected in May, rising 1.8% versus 1.3%
            consensus and up from a fall of -2.2% the previous month. DB UK economist
            George Buckley noted that this was more encouraging than last week&apos;s CBI
            report, which showed reported sales falling for a sixth consecutive month
            to -11%. There are reasons to be positive on consumer spending, including
            employment, lower inflation and improving confidence. Buckley also noted
            that the UK&apos;s construction PMI came out better than expected (50.8 versus
            49.8 consensus). The index has now risen for the past three months.
            Housing is expanding substantially and should provide some optimism about
            economic growth going forward. GBP/USD rallied 27 pips on the PMI data to
            1.5323.

            Japan prime minister Shinzo Abe will call on Japan&apos;s giant pension funds
            to lift their allocations to domestic stocks and take a more active
            approach to investment, as the prime minister seeks ways to sustain new
            found interest in the world&apos;s second-biggest equity market, reports the
            FT. The government will launch a review of the funds in order to boost
            holdings of equities and foreign assets. The review will be announced
            alongside other government measures to boost growth, on Wednesday. The
            news helped Japanese stocks, with the Nikkei closing 1.5% higher on the
            day.

            Turkish deputy prime minister Bulent Arinc blamed police for sparking
            clashes after they fired tear gas at a demonstration to save a public park
            in Istanbul. He said that Turkey&apos;s government &apos;respects and is sensitive
            towards different lifestyles&apos; and urged protestors to end the
            demonstrations. The attempts by the government to quell the violence comes
            as Turkey&apos;s public sector workers unions started a two-day strike to
            protest against &apos;state terror&apos; directed towards the demonstrators.

            Australia&apos;s Q1 current account balance showed a smaller deficit than
            expected, at AUD -8.5bn versus -9bn consensus. DB Australia economist Adam
            Boyton noted that the balance in goods and services recorded a surplus of
            AUD 0.4bn versus a deficit of AUD 5.2bn in Q4. Within this, goods imports
            fell AUD --3bn driven by a fall in capital goods imports. AUD/USD was
            little changed.

            The RBA left interest rates on hold at its June meeting, in line with
            consensus forecast and with the rates market pricing only 4bp. DB
            Australia economist Adam Boyton said that little had changed for the RBA
            over the past month, with a strong easing bias retained and Boyton
            maintained his forecast of a 25bp rate cut in Q3. On currency depreciation
            he noted that while the central bank acknowledged the recent fall in AUD,
            they still see it as &apos;over-valued.&apos; AUD/USD chopped in a 50 pip range over
            the announcement before returning to where it had started around 0.9720.

            Other European Data

            Eurozone PPI was weaker than expected in April, falling -0.6% mom versus
            -0.2% consensus

            Good day everyone,

            Gold GCQ3 Daily &amp; Hourly Clouds:


            The Standard Line has been capping the gold price fairly effectively so far.
            The market has not closed above that level since the 9th of May.

            However, recent action suggests that the market is trying to breach that line.

            Resistance at $1441 from the Daily Cloud base

            Daily resistance at $1413 from the Standard Line

            Intraday support at $1403 from the Hourly Cloud

            Support at $1388 from the Turning Line


            Gold GCQ3 1 min $2:

            Pulling back towards support at $1394, with targets clustering at $1428. Overall bullish above $1390.


            Resistance at $1438

            Resistance at $1422

            Support at $1394

            Support at $1386


            Silver SIN3 Daily &amp; Hourly Clouds:

            Very little directional interest short term with the price oscillating around the hourly cloud for the last
            several days. There is a bullish cross of the Turning and Standard Lines.

            Resistance at $24.41 from the Daily Cloud Base
            Resistance at $23.55
            Support at $22.36 from the Standard Line


            Silver SIN3 1 min 10 cents:

            Testing the uptrend support. $23.20 is the KEY number to trade above in order to break the downside counts,
            and $21.90 the key number to break on the downside to get ride of the up side price targets.

            Resistance at $23.10

            Resistance at $22.70

            Support at $22.50

            Support at $21.90


            Platinum PLN3 Daily &amp; Hourly Clouds:

            Yesterday’s rally hit trend line resistance at $1505.60.
            Expect volatile but ‘trend-free’ behaviour with the price within the cloud.

            Resistance at $1555 from the Daily Cloud top

            Resistance at $1505 from the trend line resistance

            Support at $1477 from the Standard Line &amp; $1475 from the Turning Line

            Support at $1464 from the Hourly Cloud base


            Platinum PLN3 1 min $2:

            A positive short term outlook for platinum as far as PLN3 trades above $1446...

            Resistance at $1514

            Resistance at $1504

            Support at $1474

            Support at $1448


            Palladium PAU3 Daily Cloud:

            A zone of congestion between $744-764.

            Resistance at $785

            Support at $745 from the Turning Line

            Support at $722 from the Standard Line

            Support at $716 from the Trend Line


            Palladium PAU3 Daily $5:

            And now for a complete change...owing to a technical fault in the feed to the 1 min chart, a look at the
            bigger picture. Pd needs to break above the $785 level where the red box is, and close above that level on
            this daily chart in order to knock out the downside counts that extend as deep as $560, but mainly point
            towards $635.

            Resistance at $785

            Resistance at $770

            Support at $730-735


            Best regards,

            Nick

            HUNGARY LOCAL: HGB and IRS ylds down 15-20bp
        </Subject>
        <MsgBody>
            HGB curve is flattening, mid curve yields are down about 15-20bps and long end is trading 10-15 bps lower.
            Rally was due to short covering on the street. Our flow was not meaningful at all. We haven’t seen any RM
            interest. We had a 3 months T/bill auction today at an average of 4.19%. Market is quiet now.

            In swaps, rates sliding further on payer&apos;s stops.

            2y 3.98/03 (-12)
            5y 4.20/25 (-15)
            10y 4.80/85 (-20)

            Bond levels&gt;
            16/d 4.55/4.45 -10
            17/b 4.60/4.50 -17
            17/a 4.70/4.60 -17
            18/a 4.95/4.85 -15
            23/a 5.45/5.35 -15

            We will have the conference call with the government’s economic advisor (Gyorgy Barcza) this afternoon. A
            nice checkpoint to assess what could be the pipeline of new economic measures in the medium term. On the
            policy front, the government continues to push for further utility price cuts. This time around, the
            parliament approved another 10% gas prices (bottled gap), to be effective on 1 July. The government is also
            planning an additional cut in utility prices by the autumn. All in all, it is difficult to see any big
            rebound in Hungarian CPI, given the highly deflationary environment. The background still gives ample room
            for a couple of cuts more in the policy rates, at least.

            RUSSIA LOCAL: OFZs 5 -10bp lower after 2 weeks of selling
        </Subject>
        <MsgBody>
            Russian local market opened stronger due to short-covering driven mainly by the local interest. Yield fell
            15-20bp to yesterday&apos;s closing levels, though we saw some correction in the afternoon. Offshores were
            seen on the bids with no interest to sell. Minfin decision to cancel auction which was due to take place
            today with Russian holiday next Wednesday looks to be supportive for the market.

            Manufacturing growth expanded at its weakest pace in five months in May, as output was close to stagnating
            due to weaker new orders, a survey showed on Monday. Russia&apos;s HSBC purchasing managers&apos; index
            (PMI) fell to 50.4 in May from 50.6 in the previous month. It is not the dominant industry in the Russian
            economy (as it accounts for only 16% of the Russian economy) but it gives investors a glimpse of the general
            estate of the Russian economy, which is also struggling with some deceleration in oil output.

            Brazil - Local News - by David Beker
        </Subject>
        <MsgBody>
            1. Valor Newspaper brings an article from Delfim Netto, former Finance Minister and one key economic advisor
            of President Dilma, defending a tighter fiscal Policy. He notes that all Brazil needs right now to increase
            the monetary policy effectiveness is a tighter fiscal policy. Our view: the hawkish 50bp interest rate hike
            last year was aimed in increasing the credibility of economic policy in Brazil. The fiscal side remains the
            weaker link here. A tighter fiscal would be welcomed by the markets as a decisive sign that there was a good
            policy shift. We believe that the likelihood for a tighter fiscal policy at this point is low.
            2. Valor newspaper brings an article from Cludia Safatle saying that President Dilma was worried about the
            impact of higher inflation in her popular support which led her to tell BCB&apos;s President Alexandre
            Tombini to give interviews (Magazine Veja, Folha de Sao Paulo and TV Globo) reinforcing that Dilma gave full
            support to the rate increase and that inflation is going to decline. The article adds that the government
            perception is that growth is weak but employment is still solid so there is not much downside from
            increasing more the interest rates. The article concludes that is inflation declines ahead, the government
            will be removing from the opposition the inflation speech against Dilma in next year&apos;s election. Our
            view: the duration of the tightening cycle is very uncertain at this point. The risk appears to be for more
            hikes rather than less. We expect this to lead the local yield curve to flatten.
            3. Today we will get April IP at 8:00 EST. Our view: we expect a 1% mom growth. According to Bloomberg,
            forecasts range between 0.4% and 1.7%.

            South Africa: From the off usdzar and irs curve were both offered. 5yr leveraged receivers evident with the
            market now a lot cleaner in the fwd space. We saw paying interest in decent size from models in the shorter
            end but they were also active receivers in 5s. With USDZAR retracing almost as quickly as it went up, bonds
            and swaps both benefitted. However, the 213/209/2048 auction was disappointing and with a very poor btc in
            the 209s in particular, some of the shine was taken off the move. However, the leveraged fraternity
            definitely prefers to attempt receivers here and we are likely to see some fading of another move higher in
            yield.

            Turkey: Our local office continue to see the international press as somewhat overplaying the protests and
            with some better sentiment around and the CBRT not tightening the funding liquidity we have seen a
            relatively strong retracement in the bonds. Whilst we had liked to fade the selloff in TBills our target
            level was a touch too greedy and our target of 6.70 to buy in may15s looks a long way off now. Spot flows
            have been light and the move has been more of a drift lower than anything too dramatic, with the basket back
            to 2.1650 from 2.1720 on the open. Deputy PM Arinc commented on the protests, calming markets to a small
            degree.

            Elsewhere, Czech GDP came out weaker than expected at -2.2% yoy vs -1.9% p &amp; e but did little to
            stimulate the curve, which sits pretty much unchanged on the day. Poland fared mildly better, strengthening
            around 3bps or so as the zloty rallied a couple of bf on the day. Likewise Hungary saw a good retracement in
            both spot and bonds, with the curve bull flattening around 15bps. We saw decent receiving interest in the
            belly from models, but generally flows in CE have been disappointing.

            Some morning thoughts..
        </Subject>
        <MsgBody>
            Interesting how usdcad, usdjpy and audusd all returned to pre ISM levels and yet eurusd has no interest in
            heading back to its 1.2965 level. Despite heading into ECB. Think it shows relatively vulnerabilities. Trend
            changes in US ISM in recent months leaves the US towards the bottom 30 percentile which does not seem
            logical to me.. but as Ruskin says ISM often leads at turning points, so will take some work to unwind the
            ISM doubts... Euro range very narrow so far today and even though trade unlikely to matter seems to the
            topside extension for now. Can the Dow rise for the 21 st Tuesday in a row? Usdjpy finally showing some life
            and perhaps yesterday was the bottom of the range. ESM BANK-AID PLAN SAID TO BE DELAYED AFTER GERMAN-FRENCH
            PAPER
            no surprise really, was always a stretch that any sort of agreement on this would have been achieved before
            German election...

        <MsgBody>
            ** In focus **
            - The recent surge in UST yields will probably be reversed soon, bringing some relief to the Russian
            eurobond market

            ** Credit story **
            - Altimo backs away from OTH purchase: risks of consolidation of Egyptian operator on VimpelCom’s (ВВ/Ba3/–)
            balance is off. Neutral for company bonds

            ** Market pulse **

            * Russian eurobonds: stable UST yields help sovereigns *
            - The overnight unexpected plunge in the ISM Manufacturing index and some “pro-QE” comments from FOMC
            members are lending support to financial markets today with the UST10 YTM virtually stable at 2.13%. With
            little data to track today, the cautious calm of the markets will probably remain in place for the rest of
            the day with the most important data this week (May payrolls data due out on Friday) being on investors’
            mind.
            - So far, the stabilization in UST yields has helped Russian eurobonds pare their overnight losses. RUSSIA30
            (YTM 3.45%) is up by 0.41 pps to 121.72% of par with its spread over UST10 narrowing 8 bps to 132 bps.
            RUSSIA42 (YTM 4.92%) is the leader here with quotes up by 0.75 pps to 110.82% of par. Price gains among
            corporate and banking issues are limited and do not exceed 0.1-0.2 pps.

            * Local market: ruble is down. Long-awaited correction in bonds *
            - The ruble is paring its yesterday appreciation, which was driven by an intraday surge in oil prices
            (+1.7%) and CBR interventions (est. $70 mln). This morning the USDRUB rate rose 14 kopecks to RUB 31.92
            mark, and the bi-currency basket also climbed 14 kopecks to the RUB 36.33 level. We expect the CBR to
            continue its market operations, but the loss of strong oil momentum (July Brent futures slightly down 0.2%
            DoD) could play a significant role in pressuring the local currency.
            - The local market took a breather after five consecutive days of sell-off. So far, most activity is seen in
            long issues with the 14Y 26207 benchmark yield declining 12 bps to 7.46% (+0.95 pps in price), 10Y 26211 is
            down 14 bps in yield to 7.22% (+1.05 pps in price). Mid-duration papers (26204, 25081) are up 0.25-0.30 pps
            in price, and the short-term 2Y 25079 gained 0.25 pps in price. Considering the heavy losses seen earlier
            the positive momentum is expected to last throughout the day.

            Interesting chart from Oliver Harvey.... still it has been cheap to hedge Cad, more than mxn.. still charts
            worth a look.
            Today&apos;s FX Daily highlights the vulnerability of CAD to a turnaround in US fixed income flows. For
            those looking for entry points, our just-released technical report suggests USD/CAD is currently the best
            cross to trade in G10. It is trending, not overstretched and has smooth price action (download report:
            http://pull.db-gmresearch.com/p/851-4240/85814430/0900b8c086e018ad.pdf).

            When it comes to what capital flow drives the dollar and its crosses, US investors’ foreign/domestic
            portfolio allocation is the single most important variable.* Given the focus on Fed tapering-related
            unwinds, which markets have been the biggest recipients of bond flows from the US pre and post-QE?

            In G10 the clear standout is Canada, where massive inflows since 2010 almost eclipse everything since the
            nineties. This should not be surprising given its geographic proximity to and economic and financial
            linkages with the US, but highlights how vulnerable CAD will be in an environment of Fed normalization and
            continued BoC dovishness in light of the wobbly housing sector. The UK has been a preferred destination for
            US investors too, and GBP will suffer if the recent trend of gilt liquidations continues. Interestingly,
            Australia and New Zealand appear less vulnerable. Both benefitted from large inflows since 2000 (in the
            latter a heady 13.2% of GDP), but not at the unfavorable levels of recent years, with both seeing US
            investors net sellers of domestic bonds since 2010.

            Turning to EM, Lat Am stands out. Mexico and Chile were both on the end of inflows as large as 4% of GDP.
            This reinforces the point that MXN cannot be seen as a high beta play on USD strength, but rather the boat
            closest to the US shore when the tide comes in. CLP could be on the receiving end of a double whammy:
            commodity price led deterioration in the trade balance and portfolio flow reversal. In EMEA, Hungary and
            South Africa seem most vulnerable; particularly the former where post-2010 inflows eclipse everything
            before. Turkey is not in this category, however. This bodes well for TRY, particularly if European investors
            decide to re-risk their portfolios. Asia seems the least vulnerable of all, with most countries recycling
            current account surpluses into US assets, and India and Indonesia only modest recipients of inflows.

        <MsgBody>
            While everyone was watching 10yrs in repo (opened up at -2.65 and gapped quickly to -3), 3yrs also managed
            to heat up dramatically...trading up at -0.75 o/n and at -0.65 until 6/17...they have since traded back to
            -0.45/-0.63 but still something worth keeping an eye on

            Rates opening a tad higher on the back of the stronger than expected 1.8% Apr. Industrial Production (1.0%
            survey). We continue to see more appetite for paying rates but the number of clients that have been involved
            since last week&apos;s Copom has been below average. Local press bringing an article mentioning Dilma&apos;s
            support to the tightening in rates as inflation has become the weak link of her government. It seems that as
            we approach next years election, inflation can drain some of Dilma&apos;s popularity and the Government is
            keen in keeping her numbers as high as possible even if that means less growth. (Marco Marchese)

            Behavioral Finance: Monsoon hopes may be lost on gold - key level 1383

            Gold (1405.00) The arrival of pre-monsoon rains has put Indian farmers in an upbeat mood, gold traders too.
            As meteorological services predict a normal monsoon season, the hope is that agriculture will lend a
            tailwind for the economy and that wealthier farmers will provide a fillip for gold demand. We have some
            doubts about the reliability of the latter, however, as mid-April&apos;s massive gold price sell-off may
            well have attracted some of the demand that would otherwise have appeared only later in the year. Official
            Indian gold imports soared 138 percent year-on-year in April, and were even higher in May. So it may well
            have been that these farmers, sensing that the suddenly cheaper metal was an opportunity not to be missed,
            brought forward their gold purchases. Subsequent demand, in this case, could easily disappoint. Either way,
            the Indian government appears to be preparing more restrictions for gold imports. The country&apos;s economy
            is currently growing at the slowest pace in a decade. That Indian consumers plough so much of their cash
            into imported gold, which they then squirrel away, is clearly not ideal for domestic growth or for the
            balance of payments. However, the imposition of curbs appears merely to enhance the scarcity value of gold
            rather than discourage would-be buyers.

            Although we expect retail demand - in India and elsewhere - to dwindle, we also note that investor sales
            have also tapered off. This leaves short-term traders to determine the price action. Yesterday, they reacted
            to weak US ISM numbers to adjust their forecasts for a withdrawal of Fed stimulus. We believe they will
            continue to trade the market from the long side at 1383.00/4.00, and 1425.00/8.00 probably marks the top of
            the range.

            Silver (22.6100) Although the market remains broadly stable, the price would have to overstep 23.0500 to
            avoid a possible dip to as low as 21.4000. Once broken, though, we would look for gains to 23.8000.

            Copper (7352) Yesterday&apos;s PMIs in China, Europe and in the US suggested the global economy was still
            struggling, which means weak interest in base metals. The downgraded IMF forecast for German growth, the
            eurozone&apos;s locomotive, also portended badly for the rest of the year. However, copper could profit from
            supply concerns. The Indonesian Grasberg mine - recently closed after an accident - has delayed its
            reopening and this keeps copper prices buoyant. The metal still clings to middle of our well known 7150 -
            7650 trading range, but we favour a near-term climb to its upper end, while the (critical) lower border
            stands.

            Mbonos are trading 9 bps tighter. Very poor liquidity at the moment and wide prices at screens. No flows so
            far. It seems that inflows of yesterday left short positions to local desks and they&apos;re trying to cover
            them early in the morning with no liquidity. Today there will be 3y Mbono auction (June-16) for 8.5 billion

            RBS| RUSSIA CPI COMMENT - Tatiana Orlova
        </Subject>
        <MsgBody>
            Russian CPI: the main culprits behind the poor May reading were fruit &amp; veg prices (up 6.5% MoM) and
            transport tariffs (up nearly 5% MoM). The seasonal rise in fruit &amp; veg prices was apparent from the
            weekly readings and was incorporated into the market forecast. It has contributed about 0.25ppts to the
            monthly reading of 0.7%. However, the rise in transportation tariffs was unexpected, and is responsible for
            about 0.16 ppts increase in the CPI index. At 0.3% MoM, core inflation was actually lower than in April
            (0.4% MoM). (Tatiana Orlova)

            US ISM was very disappointing yesterday and sent the USD and DXY careening lower through a good pivot of
            82.90/83.00 to a low of 82.42. The USD has proceeded to bounce very well against many pairs, JPY, CHF, AUD,
            and CAD, but not against the EUR and GBP as much proving ISM&apos;s bark to be worse than its bite.
            Interesting considering we are back to an old theme where the DXY is supported by weakness in some of its
            lesser components, but not the EURUSD. We shall see if that changes on Thursday when we hear what Super
            Mario has to say. The FT ran an article yesterday pm that said the ECB has realized they have little room to
            maneuver to aid in the bank lending process. The one step they could take would be to cut the depo rate to
            negative as that would force banks to use the excess liquidity rather than parking it at the ECB. Finnish PM
            said overnight that negative rates would not be that affective, despite the ECB board member Likkanen
            recently stating that he would open to the idea. EURUSD has taken out the daily trendline and is now
            pressing up against the 100d ma(see chart). I am anticipating any break of this level would be a false one
            and short lived as the 1.3200 level should provide very good resistance. The one danger to this view is
            Draghi coming out and sounding less dovish and causing more of a position covering. Are there still EUR
            shorts out there? USDJPY yesterday traded down to 98.86 on a panic liquidation move and now we see a 1.5%
            bounce. Tonight Abe will release his growth strategy in a speech where James Malcolm anticipates corporate
            tax cuts, but we are told won&apos;t reveal the entire strategy. USDJPY is higher than where we were going
            into the ISM and a close back above 100.70 would be very bullish. I am still long USDs against JPY, and long
            EURCHF. I have dipped my toe back into being long USDs against CAD, AUD, and CHF. The price action post ISM
            seems to be telling us that all our focus needs to be solely on NFP&apos;s roar on Friday(with some
            attention paid to Mario Thursday). Good Luck.

            RBS| Chile Minutes Confirm Dovish Tone (Felipe Hernandez)
        </Subject>
        <MsgBody>
            Chile | Minutes confirm dovish tone and have explicit easing bias. According to the minutes from the last
            monetary policy meeting the central bank weighted the possibility of cutting the benchmark interest rate by
            25bps in May. Officials noted lower interest rates would be consistent with evidence of weaker domestic
            demand and economic growth in the first quarter and downside risks from lower copper prices and decelerating
            economic activity in emerging markets. Interest rate cuts would also be consistent with low headline and
            core inflation and well anchored inflation expectations. Some of the members of the board also said lower
            interest rates would also allow adjusting for relative tighter monetary conditions when considering real
            interest rates and interest rate cuts by other central banks in emerging markets and the developed world. In
            the end the central bank unanimously decided to keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged and wait for more
            information to confirm weaker growth and low and stable inflation before cutting rates. The central bank
            remains cautious, as consumption growth remains high and keeps strong positive momentum. Evidence of still
            tight labor market conditions and the widening current account deficit also supported the decision. We
            expect inflation to remain low and domestic demand and economic growth to further moderate this year and the
            central bank to cut the benchmark interest rate before the end of 2013. New numbers on economic activity and
            salaries on Thursday and inflation on Friday this week should provide important information, but we believe
            the central bank is still likely to keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 5% in the next monetary
            policy meeting on June 13 and wait at least until the next meeting before making an adjustment. We expect
            the quarterly monetary policy report (Ipom) scheduled to be released later this month to have a clear easing
            bias. We still like receiving rates and maintain our initial receiver position on two-year CLP-Camara rates
            (RBS, Chile | Timing the easing cycle, May 7). [Felipe Hernandez]

            US ECON: Trade deficit a bit narrower, no implications
        </Subject>
        <MsgBody>
            The trade deficit prints a bit narrower than expected, though with the back-month revision this is largely a
            wash. The m/m widening was both in the nominal balance and the price adjusted metric. In terms of GDP
            implications, the real deficit for Q2 is practically unchanged relative to the Q1 average and thus it still
            looks as though trade will be a net neutral to topline growth. We already have zero contribution from trade
            baked into our 1.5% Q2 GDP call, so this report changes nothing.

            CANADA. Trade data recap from strategy
        </Subject>
        <MsgBody>
            Canadian trade for April prints at -$0.57bn, which was as expected.

            Imports rose for a fourth consecutive month to a record high of $40.8 billion. The increase in imports was
            led by energy products, motor vehicles and parts, and metal ores and non-metallic minerals. Overall, volumes
            were up 1.5%.

            Exports edged down to $40.3 billion, as decreases in metal ores and non-metallic minerals, energy products,
            and industrial machinery, equipment and parts were partially offset by a large increase in metals and
            non-metallic mineral products. Overall, prices declined 0.7%, while volumes were up 0.5%.

            Exports to countries other than the United States fell 5.6% to $10.2 billion, as decreases were recorded in
            most principal trading areas. Imports from countries other than the United States were relatively unchanged
            in April at $14.6 billion. As a result, Canada&apos;s trade deficit with countries other than the United
            States increased from $3.8 billion in March to $4.4 billion in April.

            In real terms, trade balance moves back into deficit territory at -$0.3bn from +$0.054bn the prior month
            Compared to the Q1 average (which saw a blockbuster quarter for trade&apos;s contribution), we are roughly
            10.5% above for exports relative to Q1 average; 7.3% above for imports relative to Q1 average; By itself,
            this suggests a 0.8ppt contribution from trade (from 1.5ppt in Q1)

            The euro had a quick look over 1.3100 and since then all the e flow has been selling Fast Money, Bank and
            short-term model accounts.. Ruskin notes US April trade data with downward revision to the deficit for March
            is consistent with very favorable trends, to the extent that since the early 1970s, the trade deficit is
            typically deteriorating at this point in the cycle, and there is still no sign of that. This is partly a
            story of an improved energy picture, and in part subdued demand still suppressing non-petroleum imports
            while a weakish USD helping the export sector. This is one part of the medium-term stronger USD story, even
            if on the day the data will have no impact (as has become a pattern since the early 1990s)! On GDP the
            margin this is a positive for Q2 GDP (which we peg at 2.3%). However, we do not have enough data on the
            quarter (and the upward surprise on trade is not sufficiently strong) to tinker with our forecast... So usd
            slowing regaining some losses and absorbing some usd bulls keen to pare their risk.. would be encouraging to
            see nzd back under 80 cents... McCrann argues subtle change in wording captures entire RBA perspective A
            SINGLE word change in yesterday&apos;s RBA statement signalled a significant shift in its policy stance --
            what might be termed, an ``easing&apos;&apos; in its ``easing bias&apos;&apos;. That the inflation outlook
            ``may&apos;&apos; (my emphasis again) provide some scope for further easing, should that be required to
            support demand&apos;&apos;. Not only has ``would&apos;&apos; become ``may&apos;&apos;, but Stevens has
            inserted -- for the first time -- the further qualifier of ``some&apos;&apos; to the scope for easing.
            He has subtly but distinctively eased the easing bias. We still only have one more rate cut penciled in for

            and judged that the nation’s exchange rate remains high even after the biggest monthly drop since 2011.

            Highlights

            Market sentiment was rather subdued overnight as markets continue to debate what global central banks will
            do in the days ahead. Questions emerged about the US economic recovery following yesterday’s weak ISM data
            but the real focus will be on Friday&apos;s NFP data. The RBA left rates unchanged at 2.75% and maintained
            an easing bias leaving the door open to further cuts. Governor Stevens says sees scope for further easing
            and AUD remains high. The AUD/USD initially traded higher on the RBA announcement but the move was quickly
            reversed as the statement with the easing bias hit the wires. For now the downside is supported with bids
            from leveraged names into session lows with more layered into .9600. However selling rallies seems to be the
            near term theme with offers above .9700 into .9750 limiting gains.

            Elsewhere in Asia, Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga said FX markets are in adjustment phase and is
            unperturbed over stock volatility. EconMin Amari said currency having “complicated” movements, correction
            phase natural for weak JPY and high stock prices. PM Abe commented ahead of Wednesday&apos;s speech that he
            saw unstable movements in financial markets but signs of recovery in production, consumption and GDP. He
            noted that the strong JPY resulted in companies less interest to invest and to utilize all measures to
            promote private sector investment which was a main sector for growth. Also of note, NZ FinMin English said
            that the stronger NZ economy is helping the government’s books, and it remains on track for a surplus in
            2015.

            In Europe, some of the data was better than expected as Spanish Net Unemployment declined for third straight
            month and the UK PMI Construction moved into growth territory for first time in 8t months. Looking at the
            equities, the Nikkei put in a strong performance overnight which supported the other Asian/Pacific indexes
            and also gave USD/JPY some much needed support. The European bourses and the US stock futures are also
            higher as we head into the US open.

            FX markets have been subject to some consolidation following the moves seen yesterday. USD/JPY was able to
            move back above parity as investors re-position ahead of Wednesday&apos;s speech by Japan PM which is
            expected to reveal the government&apos;s growth target. Topside now has offers at 100.50 with stops above
            100.60 but more offers come into play ahead of 100.80-00. Bids are now placed below 99.80 into 99.50. EUR
            remains supported by bids at 1.3035-40 and then at 1.3000-10 while topside is limited with offers at
            1.3100-10 and then 1.3130-50. GBP spiked higher on the better than expected Construction PMI data but has
            been unable to sustain its gains. Offers at 1.5340-50 remains on the topside while bids at 1.5255-60 and
            d1.5200-10 are expected to dictate ranges.

            In addition to the trade data today, IMF&apos;s Lagarde speaks on Global Economic Outlook at Brookings, Fed&apos;s
            Raskin speaks on Employment in Washington, Fed’s George speaks on Economy in New Mexico and Fed&apos;s
            Fisher speaks on Monetary Policy in Toronto.

            Good Luck. Mike

            **TRY vol update

            From: ASHWATH VENKATARAMAN (HSBC, TSY &amp; CAP MKTS)
            At: Jun 4 2013 08:53:27

            TRY vol is another leg lower now. 3m last got given @ 8.9, it opened 9.65-10.0 this morning.

            We are reasonably light, but have a small residual long. The market&apos;s fear of course, is that spot goes
            back down to 1.83 and the vol goes back to 7.00 in 6mth as the locals unleash endless amounts of vol and the
            CBT rejoices.

            This is unlikely to materialize - bond holders in Turkey have seen their bonds get sold very aggressively,
            and they are likely to want to reduce on retracements. Political noise, and the ultimate weakness in Turkish
            macro policy are also more obvious now, and the all of this together should result in sustained higher
            volatilie in the Lira in the med term.

            The options to buy are 6m-1yr 25-50dta TRY calls. Thanks to the massive skew, these trade very low relative
            to the ATM, and provide excellent gamma/theta ratios. They will not perform on an outright blow up, but they
            will do very well in a slow burner increased volatility environment.

            USDTRY 1m-3m 8.7/9.1 6m 8.8/9.2 1y 9.15/9.55

            Fitch Ratings has downgraded OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes S.A.&apos;s (OGX)
            foreign and local currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to &apos;B-&apos; from &apos;B&apos; and
            its long-term National Scale rating to &apos;BB+(br)&apos; from &apos;BBB-(br)&apos;.

            Fitch has also downgraded the rating of the company&apos;s USD2.6 billion and
            USD1.1 billion notes to &apos;B-/RR4&apos; from &apos;B/RR4&apos;. OGX&apos;s wholly owned subsidiary,
            OGX AUSTRIA GMBH, is the issuer of both notes. These notes are unconditionally
            and irrevocably guaranteed by OGX, OGX Petroleo e Gas Ltda. and OGX Campos
            Petroleo e Gas S.A.

            The Rating Outlook has been revised to Negative from Stable.

            KEY RATING DRIVERS

            The rating downgrades reflect concern about OGX&apos;s liquidity due to its
            aggressive acquisition of 13 exploratory blocks during a time in which the
            company is implementing an aggressive investment program and is struggling to
            bring oil and gas production on line. The exploratory blocks acquisition is
            valued at approximately USD190 million and has to be paid upfront within the
            next few months. Committed minimum investments for these blocks amount to
            USD350 million in the five-year exploratory period, which will further
            pressure OGX&apos;s cash needs.

            OGX continues to face operating challenges. During April, its three production
            wells were halted due to technical issues at the centrifugal submersible pump
            in well OGS-68HP, and unstable electrical generation at OSX-1 which affected
            the production in the other two wells. Of the three wells, one was very
            quickly put back into production. The second one is expected to restart
            production in May, and the third well in June.

            As of March 31, 2013, OGX had USD4.0 billion of total debt and only USD1.1
            billion of cash and marketable securities. OGX&apos;s ambitious capital expenditure
            program of approximately USD 1.3 billion in 2013 and low-to-negative EBITDA
            (depending upon the speed of recovery in production volumes) is expected to
            result in a large cash flow deficit during 2013.

            Fitch believes there is a high likelihood that OGX will need to exercise a
            USD1 billion put option against its controlling shareholder in 2013 to fund a
            portion of its negative cash flow. The recent decision by the company to sell
            a 40% stake in blocks BCM-39 and BCM-40 to Petronas is positive, but is not
            large enough to address all of the company&apos;s funding needs. Upon the
            regulators&apos; approval of such transaction, probably during the second half of
            2013, OGX is expected to receive USD250 million. An additional USD500 million
            would be received following the beginning of production of oil in these
            blocks, which is anticipated to occur in the first quarter of 2014. OGX would
            receive subsequent payments upon reaching certain production volumes.

            Following recent events, Fitch has adjusted the production volumes imbedded in
            its base case scenario to about 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day
            (boepd) in 2013; 46,000 boepd in 2014 and 94, 000 boepd in 2015. Considering
            Fitch&apos;s oil price deck, Fitch has reduced its EBITDA projection to
            approximately USD1.5 billion by 2015 from the previous 2 billion. Should
            production volumes materialize at the new indicated level, Fitch expects OGX
            to report negative free cash flow over the next three years, highlighting
            OGX&apos;s liquidity risk. In 2015, Fitch expects leverage to be about 4.0x, after
            adjusting debt for operating leases

            RATING SENSITIVITIES

            OGX&apos;s ratings may be downgraded if its liquidity risks continue to increase.
            If the company encounters additional execution issues with its exploratory and
            development plan, further negative rating actions could occur.

            A positive rating action could result from satisfactory production volumes,
            coupled with lower uncertainties regarding reserves and liquidity.

            OGX is a Brazilian oil and gas company created in 2007, 61.2% owned by EBX
            Group. OGX has a portfolio of 49 blocks in Brazil and Colombia. In Brazil,
            OGX&apos;s blocks are located in the Campos, Santos, Espirito Santo, Para-Maranhao
            and Parnaiba Basins.

            ECB SOURCES: MEMBERS DIVIDED ON FURTHER REFI RATE CUT
            ECB SOURCES:CORRIDOR NARROWING MAY BE BETTER RATE CUT STRATEGY
            ECB SOURCES: NEG RATE TALK WAY TO DEMONSTRATE ECB FIREPOWER. Saravelos argues that unless they cut the depo,
            refi largely irrelevant. As argued yesterday, maybe one way of increasing &quot;credibility&quot; of
            negative depo talk is to commit to keep corridor stable. So Draghi cuts refi, and then implies that any
            additional rate cuts HAVE to come via depo cut. That&apos;s what I would expect tomorrow. Euro holding
            1.3052 and unconcerned... Trend line on S&amp;P futures at 1654... worth fading.. we peaked last Tuesday..
            and has paid to fade the Tuesday&apos;s rallies... ISM impact slowly fading away..

            TIPS: in a holding pattern w/ the rest of the market
        </Subject>
        <MsgBody>
            ** we closed yesterday with some decent BEI buying and then opened today with some decent overseas demand.

            ** we&apos;re not going anywhere though as US investors have already lined up so sell the strength.

            ** My best guess is that we&apos;re pretty balanced here +/- 2bps of this 219 level in 10yr BEI into Friday.
            I don&apos;t think an ADP will jar the TIPS market as it&apos;s too frequently a red herring

            ** Our thoughts remain the same:
            1- neutral intermediate and longer BEIs. The BEI is too low &amp; real rate too high to sell ahead of NFP
            and yet they trade too poorly and 30yr supply to much of an unknown to buy. Looking ahead to positive July
            seasonal period.
            2- favor 4/14s, 4/15s and 4/16s (outright &amp;/or BEI vs everything else)
            3- think 2020 paper and 2029s have been beaten up enough on the curve. doesn&apos;t mean they won&apos;t get
            beaten more, just that they aren&apos;t RV rich anymore.

        <MsgBody>
            EUR/USD - A daily close above 1.3063 would trigger a bullish trend reversal in EUR/USD that would target a
            triple top at 1.3200 next, followed by 1.3309. Support is located at 1.3063 and 1.2843 - with a close below
            the latter level required for a bearish trend reversal.

            The recent bullish short-term trend reversal in GBP/USD features 1.5320 and 1.5429 as the next resistance
            targets to watch. The 1.5429 level is the most important, as a daily close above here would reverse the
            downtrend that has been in place for all of 2013 (would open up 1.5551 thereafter). Support is located at
            1.5139 and 1.5023 - with a close below the double bottom at 1.5023 required to commence a new phase of
            bearish

            USD/JPY is testing support at 99.75 as part of the recent corrective phase. While a daily close below this
            level would open up 98.46 on the downside, we expect moves to this level to attract renewed buying interest
            based on the intermediate uptrend that is in place. Initial resistance is located at 102.12, with a close
            above 103.59 required for a bullish breakout.

            USD/CHF - corrective pullbacks to support at 0.9435 and 0.9326 are expected to attract renewed buying
            interest in USD/CHF based on the uptrend that has been in place this year. Resistance is located at 0.9594
            and 0.9808 - with a close above the double top at 0.9808 required to confirm a bullish breakout.

            EUR/CAD features resistance targets between 1.3521 and 1.3566 after the recent bullish trend reversal above
            1.3403. This level now serves as initial support, followed by 1.3332. A return below 1.3403 will be required
            at a minimum in order to neutralize the bullish backdrop

            CAD/JPY is trying to bounce off of key ascending channel support at 96.66 as the daily studies move to
            oversold levels. A daily close above initial resistance at 97.68 would neutralize the recent selloff,
            exposing 99.70 next.

            Looking at some TY week 1 and week 2 put flys to have on thru NFP..
            Week 1 Week 2
            129-128.5-128 PF 2-4 3-5
            129-128-127 PF 11-12 10-11
            128.5-127.5-126.5 PF 6-8 7-8

            I like the 2.25% target yield in the 129-128.5-128 put fly, but might be a bit narrow...

            One thing to remember is the meeting was in the middle of May, which was to some degree before we saw the
            big push higher in USD rates. There was a reference to other countries’ rates in the minutes and in view of
            this, as well as the strong retail sales number we got at the end of May, I’d say BCCh still has time to
            wait before cutting. Remember also last time they cut 25bp they were left with egg on their face as they had
            to make it a “one and done” with growth picking up, so I think they will wait for as long as possible before
            initiating a cut. Another consideration is the new inflation methodology – I think they will also wait to
            see the effects on this change before doing anything. Currently I like 2s5s steepners.

            USD Venny with better face this morning. Volatility has arrived to stay for a
            while, poor liquidity is poisoning the prices. VENZ31 is trading at 101, VENZ27
            is at 90.20 (strong support at 89). On the news flow: there is no material
            news, only the noisy that Capriles is doing after his visit to Colombia, very
            important in term of legality (more difficult for Venezuela to negotiate loans
            or issue a debt when the opposition is selling illegitimacy). Indicative
            prices:

            US: Trade deficit widens in April with increases in imports and exports

            The April trade report—including annual revisions—was slightly more favorable for growth than we had been
            anticipating. The nominal trade balance widened from -$37.1bn in March to -$40.3bn in April while the real
            goods balance widened from -$44.6bn to -$47.6bn. The real goods deficit reported for April was close to the
            average reported for 1Q (-$47.8bn) and it looks like net exports will be slightly more favorable for 2Q GDP
            growth than we had previously anticipated. However, we still believe there is downside risk to our 2.0% real
            GDP forecast for 2Q from other factors away from the trade data. The latest trade figures also imply a
            slight upward revision to 1Q growth and we are raising our tracking estimate of 1Q GDP growth from 2.3% to
            2.4%.
            Real merchandise trade flows increased in April after contracting in March. Real goods imports popped up
            3.3% in April after falling 3.9% in March while real goods exports increased 2.0% in April after declining
            1.1% the previous month. The monthly changes in the trade data are typically choppy, but the recent trends
            show fairly modest trade flows lately, reflecting the soft global growth environment. Real goods imports
            were essentially flat over the three months through April as well as over the most recent 12 months. And
            real goods exports increased 4.5% saar over the most recent three months and were up 1.9% over the most
            recent 12.
            The annual revision to the trade report had mixed and fairly minor implications for the goods trade balance
            over the past few years. The services balance was generally revised to be stronger in recent years (charts
            below).

            Saravelos keeping the faith and noting aud has best tie to higher US yields of late.. Another new cycle high
            today in 10yr real yields and continue to think USD pullbacks will be limited and market inclined to look
            through weak data as far as the USD goes... So we argued yesterday. PMI of 49 would generate usd selling
            short term but had hoped the usd would regain those losses by middle of the week... Euro just joining
            party.. Chad on e desk noting model selling of commodity currencies continuing post-RBA, specifically
            against USD and GBP, full reversal from yesterday&apos;s px action.

            CitiFX Trade Idea - USDJPY topside ideas

            USDJPY broke below 100 and gapped to reach 99 and below, vols were paid up on this, 1m reached 14.2. Since
            then, vols fell a bit with spot rebounding but as we are returning back above 100 again, we expect fresh
            interest for options in general and particularly for topside. Skew was trading further bid for downside
            yesterday but first prints during London morning track this climb in spot: 1m 25RR trade back flat after
            being given at 0.2 for JPY calls earlier this morning and 0.35 yesterday. The USDJPY term structure is
            sharply inverted with 1w at 18.00, 1m 14.05, 2m 13.65, 3m 13.05, 6m 12.65 and 1y 12.15. Given the current
            level of risk reversals and the inverted vol curve, we think it makes sense to reload topside options here
            ahead of the upper house elections which should help boost sentiment and Japanese equities.

            Revolt in Turkey: Erdogan&apos;s Grip on Power Is Rapidly Weakening
            By Özlem Gezer, Maximilian Popp and Oliver Trenkamp

            For a decade, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has had a tight grip on power. But it suddenly looks to be
            weakening. Thousands have taken to the streets across the country and the threats to Erdogan&apos;s rule are
            many. His reaction has revealed him to be hopelessly disconnected.

            The rooftops of Istanbul can be seen in the background and next to them is a gigantic image of Recep Tayyip
            Erdogan. Turkey&apos;s powerful prime minister is watching over the city -- and is also monitoring the work
            of the political party he controls. At least that seems to be the message of the image, which can be found
            in a conference room at the headquarters of Erdogan&apos;s Justice and Development Party (AKP).

            These days, though, Istanbul is producing images that carry a distinctly different meaning -- images of
            violent protests against the vagaries of Erdogan&apos;s rule. And it is beginning to look as though the
            prime minister, the most powerful leader Turkey has seen since the days of modern Turkey&apos;s founder
            Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, might be losing control.
            As recently as mid-May, Erdogan boasted during an appearance at the Brookings Institute in Washington D.C.
            of the $29 billion airport his government was planning to build in Istanbul. &quot;Turkey no longer talks
            about the world,&quot; he said. &quot;The world talks about Turkey.&quot;

            Just two weeks later, he appears to have been right -- just not quite in the way he had anticipated. The
            world is looking at Turkey and speaking of the violence with which Turkish police are assaulting
            demonstrators at dozens of marches across the country. Increasingly, Erdogan is looking like an autocratic
            ruler whose people are no longer willing to tolerate him.

            For years, Erdogan seemed untouchable and, at least until the recent demonstrations began, was the most
            popular politician in the country. He entered office amid pledges to reform the country and introduce even
            more democratic freedoms. In his gruff dealings with foreign powers, he gave Turkey a new kind of
            confidence. He broke the grip on power held by the country&apos;s old elite, he kick-started the economy and
            he calmed the conflict with the country&apos;s Kurdish minority.

            Democracy Lost

            But one thing got lost in the shuffle: Democracy. Success made Erdogan even more power-hungry, thin-skinned
            and susceptible to criticism. Indeed, he began governing in the same autocratic style for which he had
            bitterly criticized his predecessors. And now, he is faced with significant dangers to his power from
            several quarters.

            The biggest danger facing the Turkish premier is his own high-handedness. Though he said on Monday that he
            understood the message being sent by the protesters, there is little evidence that is true. Indeed, his
            response thus far has shown the degree to which he has become distanced from realities in his country. With
            hundreds of thousands of people taking to the streets, Erdogan has opted for confrontation rather than
            de-escalation. On Monday morning, he threatened that he would be unable to keep the 50 percent of Turks who
            voted for him from taking to the streets themselves. Critics see the comment as nothing less than a threat
            of civil war.

            He said that he won&apos;t allow &quot;a handful of plunderers&quot; to dictate policy. He also branded the
            marches as being ideological and said that they have been &quot;manipulated by the opposition.&quot;
            Twitter, he said, is the &quot;greatest threat to the society.&quot; Such sentiments are reminiscent of
            those Arab dictators who were overthrown in the Arab Spring of 2011.

            Erdogan has recently shown a complete inability to gauge the anger of the country&apos;s Kemalists. He
            recently offended the secular followers of Atatürk with comments regarding a law aiming to reduce the
            consumption of alcohol. During a party meeting, Erdogan painted a rhetorical picture of an alcoholic
            populace: He spoke of police who continually find empty bottles in people&apos;s cars, of husbands who beat
            their wives and of fathers who are a poor influence due to their consumption of beer.

            Most pointedly, however, he asked if Turkey wanted to follow a law passed by two drunks or the law of God.
            Since then, the country has been filled with speculation as to who Erdogan may have been referring to. Many
            believe it was an attack on Atatürk and his Prime Minister Ismet Inönü, who were in office when the ban on
            alcohol in the country was lifted in 1926. Furthermore, Atatürk is rumored to have died from cirrhosis of
            the liver. As such, Erdogan&apos;s comments are seen as an attack on a national hero.

            Diverse Protests

            But it isn&apos;t just the Kemalists who are now venting their rage at the Turkish prime minister.
            Demonstrations have been reported in more than 40 cities, and they are drawing more than students and
            intellectuals. Families with children, women in headscarves, men in suits, hipsters in sneakers,
            pharmacists, tea-house proprietors -- all are taking to the streets to register their displeasure.

            Thus far, no opposition party has sought to claim the protests as its own. There have been no party flags,
            no party slogans and no prominent party functionaries to be seen. Kemalists and communists have demonstrated
            side-by-side with liberals and secularists. Simply calling them all &quot;marauders and extremists,&quot; as
            Erdogan has sought to do, will not be enough.

            Another threat may also be lurking. In Istanbul, people have begun whispering that the military is
            distributing gasmasks -- but to the demonstrators rather than to the police. The message is clear: The
            military supports the protests.

            The story is certainly consistent with the Turkish military&apos;s traditional role in society. The generals
            have long seen themselves as protectors of Atatürk&apos;s legacy and as protectors of a secular Turkey.
            Indeed, the military has staged three putsches in its history to guarantee Kemalist values: in 1960, in 1971
            and again in 1980.

            Erdogan, to be sure, has done his best to reduce the military&apos;s power. He has removed some officers and
            had others locked away, convicted of conspiracy. It is difficult to predict how the military might now react
            to the protests. But Erdogan certainly cannot rely on them remaining in their barracks.

            Visit to Tunisia

            Even within his own party, the AKP, Erdogan&apos;s rule has become contentious. Turkish President Abdullah
            Gül, likewise of the AKP, has been careful to distance himself from Erdogan&apos;s comments over the weekend
            that citizens should express their opinions at the ballot box. Gül responded that &quot;democracy doesn&apos;t
            just mean casting a ballot.&quot;

            Turkish law prohibits Erdogan from running for another term. In response, however, he appears to be leaning
            toward the model followed by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Erdogan is currently seeking to increase the
            powers of the Turkish presidency, preparatory to taking over the position himself in 2014. Not everyone in
            the AKP is behind the plan and speculation of an internal power struggle is rife.
            On Monday morning, after a weekend full of some of the most intense protests Turkey has seen, Erdogan spoke
            yet again, saying he suspects that &quot;foreign powers&quot; are behind the demonstrations and that Turkish
            intelligence is investigating. &quot;It is not possible to reveal their names, but we will have meetings
            with their heads,&quot; Erdogan said, according to the English version of the Turkish daily Hürriyet. The
            strategy is transparent: The prime minister is doing all he can to portray the protests as an attack on
            Turkey.

            Erdogan is hoping that will be enough to keep the situation under control for now. This week he embarks on a
            trip through North Africa. And, after a visit to Morocco, the Turkish premier is scheduled to visit Tunisia
            -- where not so long ago, the people rose up against their autocratic ruler.

        <MsgBody>
            Romania:
            In light of heightened market concern about QE-tapering by the Fed, we address the impact it would have on
            portfolio inflows into Romania, why it matters for the country and what it would mean for monetary policy
            over the next few months. Tapering would deliver a double-blow for the &apos;receive trade&apos;. Firstly,
            and most obviously, it slows down the expansion of liquidity in the global financial system. Secondly, it
            reduces the confidence of the central bank in being able to lower policy rates and still attract portfolio
            inflows. For now, we maintain our call for four 25bps of rate cuts by year end but note that tapering would
            considerably limit the scope for easing. (Abbas Ameli-Renani)

            In an effort to avoid any Roy Hibbert-esque slipups, this commentary is just going to be the facts today.
            The facts are: FV is underperforming today more than the Pacers did last night- mainly on the curve, as it
            feels like there&apos;s a large seller of the contract around. 3s are more like Lebron- they are super rich
            (mainly on the day, and Lebron mainly in terms of actual money) and simultaneously a pretty solid bargain
            (3s are a bit cheap forward given their ridiculous term repo, Lebron would be paid about 3 times more if
            there weren&apos;t a salary cap). We saw some interest in fading 3y richness this morning- then very quickly
            we saw panicked glances and some interest in quickly covering not long after.

            May employment reports have been as consistently weak as ISM
        </Subject>
        <MsgBody>
            Lavoirgna: We are forecasting just +125k on May nonfarm payrolls and +135k on private payrolls. The reason
            is seasonal. For example, over the last three Mays, private payroll gains averaged just +69k. However, these
            figures were subsequently revised higher in each case by an average of +77k. Given the general propensity to
            revise employment
            higher—it has happened about three-quarters of the time since January
            2011—softer than expected employment should be discounted. Indeed,
            sustained sub-350k readings on initial jobless claims have always been
            associated with large gains in nonfarm payrolls well in excess of 200k.
            Jobless claims have averaged 352k year-to-date, so the health of the labor
            market is definitely getting better because lower layoffs have always
            translated into faster hiring. In the short term, the monthly ADP survey,
            which we get this morning, is the single best predictor of changes in
            payrolls. If ADP meaningfully surprises us in either direction, we will
            adjust our payroll forecast accordingly. Over the last three years—we
            exclude the recession where the errors were unusually large—we found that
            a one standard deviation move between the change in private payrolls and
            ADP has been approximately 80k. This means that if May ADP comes within
            80k (plus or minus) from our +135k estimate, we will not change our
            forecast for May employment.
            In general, we do not want to overstate the importance of the May labor
            data. Given the inherent volatility of payrolls, and the fact there are
            three more employment reports between Friday and the September 17-18 FOMC
            meeting, we do not believe a weaker than expected May reading will change
            the Fed’s intermediate term thinking, meaning we believe policymakers are
            still on track to taper at the September meeting. This assumes the
            downtrend in jobless claims persists and that we will see a step-up in
            hiring this summer. Better than expected GDP news when the comprehensive
            benchmark is released on July 31 will also provide rationale to taper.
            If the Fed tapers in September, how will it proceed? We expect the first
            cut to total $25B, split between mortgages ($10B) and treasuries ($15B) so
            that total monthly purchases decline to $60B. This would then allow the
            Fed to taper again in two successive $30B increments at the October 28-29
            and December 16-17 FOMC meetings. When asset purchases are completed, we
            should expect the Fed to pursue an active policy of reinvestment for at
            least three months. Should the economy continue to mend, this will be
            followed by roll-off of maturing securities from the Fed’s balance sheet.
            It would be at least another three months before the Fed would raise
            interest rates. We see this happening in late 2014/early 2015. Again, all
            of this assumes that the unemployment rate continues to trend lower and
            approach the Fed’s 6.5% threshold sooner than policymakers currently
            envision. —LaVorgna

            repo today (cleared for US, Europe, AEJ: $50mm+ AUM)
        </Subject>
        <MsgBody>
            good day...fed funds opened at 0.10 and last traded at 0.09; USD 3mL set at 0.27395; while o/n tsy gc has
            traded from 0.14-0.13 at the open to 0.06 at the low (last down at 0.11). $30bn 6/17 CM bills hit the street
            today.

            the deep specialness across several current tsy issues has likely become an important factor in keeping gc
            repo rates well-anchored, even with the recent coupon and CM bill settlements. while we&apos;re trading a
            good 5-7bps higher on average than where we stood at this same point last week, the overall tone and trend
            is to the downside. so how do specials play into this? well, as dealers and levered types have reduced longs
            and gone outright short treasuries across certain sectors of the curve, not only is there less inventory to
            finance, but the demand to borrow specific securities thru the general collateral rate adds further downward
            pressure on overall repo levels.

            the NY fed&apos;s weekly primary dealer statistics
            (http://www.newyorkfed.org/banking/reportingforms/primarystats/deal.txt) and DTCC GCF repo data
            (http://www.dtcc.com/products/fi/gcfindex/index.php) corroborate the price action seen in both cash and
            repo. using dealer data as a proxy for the overall mkt, positioning in treasuries have been on the decline
            since peaking in mid-april, with the belly of the curve (6-11yr securities) outright short, as of 5/22 (fed
            data is delayed by a week), and likely shorter since then. at the same time, DTCC data shows that overall
            dealer dailing financing volumes in GCF (interdealer triparty repo) have also been on the decline since the
            start of may -- from almost 320bn/day across tsy, agy, and agy MBS collateral to ~250bn avg over the past
            week -- implying less inventory to fund on a daily basis.

            as for specials, it is clear to us that the treasury market rout of the past month has broadened and
            deepened the short base, as evidenced by the specialness in old 2&apos;s, ct3&apos;s, old 5&apos;s, old 7&apos;s,
            and most notably ct10&apos;s. with the cash mkt selloff as a backdrop, the fact that 10&apos;s are only a
            24bn single issue with no SOMA lending, it is not necessarily a surprise to have seen them swiftly richen
            and gap to the -3% fails threshold for the past two days in the o/n mkt -- prompting a massive term
            richening (6/17 trading as low as -2.70, 7/15 up at -1.30, 8/15 at -0.75 and even 12/31 at -0.18). at the
            same time, we are seeing domestic real money and foreign central bank interest in lending, which could help
            in the short-term with clearing some delivery fails and breaking the logjam. no major relief, however, until
            the expected $21bn reopening, which won&apos;t settle until monday 6/17.

            the ct3&apos;s also quietly tumbled lower in repo amid the 10yr craziness, gapping from -0.15 at the open to
            -2.10 at the low. they&apos;ve since stabilized in the -0.60/-1.00 range o/n, though the term did reprice
            significantly lower in the process, with 6/17 up at -0.80 last. similar to 10&apos;s, we&apos;re also seeing
            better real money interest in lending the issue o/n and for term, so perhaps this issue will be able to
            catch its breath.

            for add&apos;l specials pricing, please contact the desk. i like to joke that we&apos;ve become &quot;lucy
            in the chocolate factory&quot; (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NPzLBSBzPI) here on the specials desk
            lately, so while it&apos;s always a good thing to be busy, it&apos;s also been a particularly hectic period!
            good luck!

            FT MARKETS: Bill Gross blasts QE, fund sees withdrawals
        </Subject>
        <MsgBody>
            Been a rough month for many mangers and two bits of news worth noting today:
            1. Gross has used his latest Investment Outlook to question the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve&apos;s
            quantitative easing policy. Here&apos;s a flavour of the argument he makes:
            Our global financial system at the zero-bound is beginning to resemble a leukemia patient with New Age
            chemotherapy, desperately attempting to cure an economy that requires structural as opposed to monetary
            solutions.
            2.Gross&apos; $285bn Total Return fund last month had its first withdrawals from investors since December,
            according to Morningstar, It was the fund&apos;s first withdrawals since late 2011.
            According to Morningstar, the withdrawals totalled $1.3bn, or just under 1.5 per cent of the fund&apos;s
            assets. May was the worst month for bond returns in almost a decade.

            Turkish Closing lvl
        </Subject>
        <MsgBody>
            Panic mode is ``off`` . Market gap opened around 15 bps today. On the back of the try move , t-bills closed
            the day 40 bps tighter and bond curve 15 bps steeper. We saw same move on the xccy side too . 1m fx swap
            marked the day 70 bps tighter. Volatility is huge but liquidity is horrible. More than 50% of market makers
            have stopped ``market making``. Linkers continued to underperform . Especially short end linkers due to neg
            carry period is getting closer and also better than expected inflation print. Now we are expecting 6.20%
            inflation for 2013 and 5.10% for 2014. I still like t-bills and will wait further to swtich short end
            linkers.

            CITI SOVS AND PERIPH BANKS CDS COMMENTARY
        </Subject>
        <MsgBody>
            Strong day across the Periph CDS today, after Spain, Italy and Portugal traded down in the street early in
            the day, before we stabilised at 5-12bps tighter on day. Client flows were biased towards selling
            protection, although the street seemed to absorb the flow with relative ease, suggesting that dealers remain
            somewhat long (especially Italy). Closing the sector 6-14bps tighter, slightly off the tights of the day.
            Core names closed unch’d to slightly tighter, with decent two way flow going through in France (traded over
            100mm).

            Periph banks also closed tighter today, for the first time since last Tuesday, as we saw client selling of
            Snr bank CDS through the morning. Dealer selling of Snr CDS continued through the afternoon, and even
            recently well bid names like SANTAN and ISPIM traded down in the street, before a late lift in UCGIM Snr led
            us to close slightly off the tights. Generically closing 8-15bps tighter on day.

            JAPAN. TRIP NOTES from ADAM COLE
        </Subject>
        <MsgBody>
            Adam Cole spent the last week visiting investors (domestic and international real money), corporates and
            trading houses in Japan. Below are some of the key themes/concerns we picked up.
             
            Generally, almost all have views dominated by US cyclical strength and an
            expectation that this plays out as a stronger USD against most of the
            majors (and an explicit or implicit view that early Fed tapering is the
            link between the two). JPY and AUD (and to a lesser extent CAD) dominated
            the individual currencies investors wanted to discuss (the former perhaps
            heightened by media focus on our off-consensus longer-term view on
            USD/JPY). Interest in EUR and GBP was patchier and the other majors did
            not figure much at all.
             
            USD/JPY. The bullish USD/JPY consensus is still less prevalent within
            Japan than it is outside Japan, though it has more subscribers than six
            months or a year ago. On USD/JPY specifically, opinion falls into three
            broad groups and each was roughly the same size.
             

            * One third were bullish, but on the view that USD is likely to rise
            across the board (as above) rather than an active view of JPY
            weakness.

             * One third are also bullish but because they are outright bearish JPY.
            Reasons are largely similar to those outside Japan – the leakage of
            BoJ QE into overseas assets, ongoing trade deficit, etc. Notably, a
            couple of large domestic institutions mentioned that if they expressed
            their bearish JPY view in asset allocations, domestic stocks would be
            the main beneficiary (rather than overseas bonds).

             * One third are outright bearish USD/JPY. This view was generally a
            result of a belief that the home investment bias evident recently will
            be ongoing in the long-term and that extended short-JPY leveraged
            positioning will eventually unwind. Several mentioned a change in the
            domestic political agenda after the upper house election (July), with
            JPY weakness becoming less critical once that hurdle has been cleared.
            A small number thought JPY upside was a simple consequence of the
            likely strength of the Japanese economy in H2. This was not a
            widespread view, but it is notable in that it has been a very long
            time since we have heard anyone suggest cyclical strength might
            underlie JPY strength.

             
            Asked about their own overseas investment and associated hedging
            behaviour, there was no sense of an imminent change in either. FX is seen
            as a source of “risk rather than return” in institutional foreign bond
            portfolios and high hedge ratios (still) reflect the low cost of hedging
            in core markets. If the cost of hedging starts to rise as a result of
            general rise in global rates (including in Japan), they will likely buy
            more JGBs rather than substitute unhedged for hedged foreign bonds.
             
            Targets for USD/JPY were mostly in the 105-110 range, with a small number
            of outliers looking for 115 and a smaller number looking for 95.
             
            AUD/USD: The collapse in AUD in May is obviously top of many investors’
            agendas, given their large holdings of unhedged AUD bonds.
             
            Japanese investor flow is likely a major factor in AUD weakness as
            overseas assets are liquidated to fund domestic equity investment (as can
            already be seen in hard data for the earlier months of the year).
            Importantly, however, this flow has so far been driven disproportionately
            by retail investors. Institutional investors’ reallocation out of AUD
            seems to have so far been limited, though several said their holdings were
            “under review”, hence their interest in discussing prospects for the
            currency.
             
            More fundamentally, several talked about the structural change in the
            composition of Chinese demand away from energy and raw material-intensive
            industries that would be a medium-term negative for AUD and others thought
            AUD still overvalued relative to the terms of trade (as per the RBA) and
            domestic corporate profits. But bearish AUD views were predominantly about
            flow rather than fundamentals.
             
            USD/CAD: Japanese investors’ interest in CAD (typically quite limited
            either way due to the lack of yield) seems to have been awoken by the
            spill-over from the US shale gas story. Most see this as a reason to be
            negative on CAD, though this is of course a very medium-term view. We
            discussed some of the potential offsets to this and factors that might
            dominate in the short-term.
             
            Elsewhere, the few clients that wanted to talk about GBP generally had a
            view that the market was too negative (in contrast to the views from
            broader Asia a couple of months ago). Interest in EUR was very limited and
            most investors seem to have come to the view that EUR/USD is simply a
            passive reflection of an active USD view and have limited expectation for
            independent direction. Otherwise, only corporates had any real interest.

            S. Africa: Monetary Policy Review (MPR)
        </Subject>
        <MsgBody>
            S. Africa: On the twice yearly Monetary Policy Review (MPR), the SARB reaffirms its GDP 2013 forecast of
            2.4% from the May MPC meeting (revised down from 2.7%) but warns on the page 1 summary that they may need to
            downgrade again at the July MPC meeting. Elsewhere, the MPR confirms the May MPC changes to the CPI forecast
            lowering the projected Q3 peak from 6.3% to 6.1%, and noting that the inflation outlook had &quot;improved
            slightly&apos; despite the significant recent weakness in currency. This may signify the SARB is expecting a
            retracement in Rand, in our view. On page 40, in the &apos;Monetary Policy&apos; section the MPR does
            indicate a change in language around inflation risks, warning that the inflation outlook &quot;remains
            persistently skewed to the upside&quot;. Compared to the &quot;risks are to the upside&quot; language in the
            May MPC statement, this suggests greater concern on the inflation outlook. Our view is that the weak
            currency is likely to lead inflation overshooting the SARB&apos;s forecast, with CPI peaking closer to 7.0%
            by Q4 and remaining above target for much of next year. We are expecting rate hikes of +150bp in H2 2014
            once GDP growth improves, but near-term we continue to expect the SARB to remain on hold given the weak
            growth outlook in the next quarter or two. From our point of view, the risk of a rate hike this year already
            would only arise if global and domestic economic conditions improved strongly enough giving the MPC
            confidence to raise rates. Our more circumspect view on growth (GDP at 2.2% in 2013) is why we continue to
            see hikes only in H2 2014.

            ****Mexico****

            Rates: Mexico sold of another 30bp this week, it is almost as beaten down as Brazil since May NFP. There was
            a small correction last week but they are back on their track of underperforming USTs, still maintaining a
            beta of much higher than 1. Historically the spread vs US has moved so abruptly in a low correlation
            environment, but during this underperformance of Mexico vs US, correlation has been fairly high. We expect
            this underperformance to correct at some point, or at least there will be reduction in beta, but the next
            NFP print will be key.

            Curves: Some signs of reduction in panic are emerging in Mexican rates in the form of curve stabilization.
            As expected, curve steepened again during the selloff but the amount of steepening was much less than what
            it had been in past few weeks, and it was better behaved. This may be a leading indicator of some
            stabilization coming back to Mexican rates, at least temporarily. Other interesting thing is the selloff in
            the extreme short end, which is trying hard to stay below the current 28D fixing, to price at least some
            cuts from Banxico this year. This Friday we will get an update on whether Banxico can remain dovish in spite
            of the weaker MXN. We think they may be and as such the very short end is attractive.

            Rich/Cheap: On a pure relative value basis 10y sector looks rich vs 5y and 30y, mostly because of the big
            selloff in 30y sector, we expect this to be the case in further sell offs also. 24s are the richest bond in
            10y sector and 36s the cheapest in 30y.

            Priced in: Markets are now pricing about 5bp cut this year, down from 20bp last week. May’s CPI print was
            the main driver behind increasing sensitivity of extreme short end to US rates. Citi&apos;s call is for no
            cut this year, although some economists on the street are calling for additional 50bp cuts this year.

            Citi Portfolio: We are neutral in Mexico, but we are still looking for better entry points for duration
            neutral curves and bond switches, some form of bear flatteners.

            Auction: 5bn 29s auction came out 2bp better than expected with a strong 3.71 bid to cover ratio. We have
            8.5bn MXN 3y Mbono auction on 4Jun13.

            ****Brazil****

            Rates: Even after being the most volatile rates in LatAm and getting a big surprise from BCB, 50bp hike vs
            25bp expected, Brazilian rates barely underperformed Mexican rates, this may make a case for them to
            underperform further to get more in line with more than expected hawkish BCB and current USTs levels. The
            central bank will find it hard to stop hiking by 50bp steps before inflation has turned down, which may now
            only happen in Q4.

            Curves: As mentioned before curve in Brazil is very steep, recent hike from BCB flattened the curve a bit.
            Two forces will be acting on the curve, BCB and USTs. In the current scenario of bearish USTs (steepens the
            curve) and hawkish BCB (flattens the curve), we expect BCB to dominate and any steepening in USTs sell off
            in USTs should improve the risk/reward ratio for flatteners.

            Rich/Cheap: NTNF 17s look cheap in the short end and 23s in the long end, 18s/19s appear to be rich.

            Priced in: DI curve is now pricing about 195bp of total hike for this year, up by 80bp since last week. Citi
            thinks likelihood for another 75bp hike is high, 150bp total for the year, up by 50bp since last week.

            Citi Portfolio: We closed our long Brazil rates DI Jan17s / NTN-17s vs US 10y, spread tightener, after BCB’s
            50bp hike. Now we are flat duration in Brazil.

            Auction: We have NTN-F 19s and 23s auction on 6Jun13

            ****Colombia****

            Rates: Big correction in TES market this week after the weak TES auction. Colombia and Peru had been lagging
            the selloff in rates but previous week’s massive selloff has over compensated for that, significantly
            reducing the risk/reward bias in being short TES vs USTs. Here onwards we expect them to perform very much
            in line with USTs. Swap spreads, which had widened significantly throughout the cutting cycle, have started
            to tighten, with TES curve underperforming in this selloff. We expect spreads to have a widening bias in
            future.

            Curves: As expected, curve steepened during this selloff, but the steepening is nowhere close to what it has
            been for Mexico and Brazil. We think steepeners in Colombia still have a favorable risk reward;
            underperformance of long end in selloff will be larger than outperformance in a rally, although not as
            favorable as Chile.

            Rich/Cheap: TES 24s pushed their historical richness levels (vs curve) further this week; even after
            normalizing for the usual liquidity premium, 24s have massively outperformed both in rallies and selloffs.
            We prefer 22s/26s over 24s for duration addition and vice versa.

            Priced in: After the recent sell off, markets are pricing some hikes at the year end. Citi is calling for
            BanRep to stay on hold. The short end of the curve is relatively attractive.

            Citi Portfolio: We are underweight duration in the portfolio. We are also short 24s vs 18Os and 28s,
            duration neutral, barbell structure to capture richness of 24s

            Auction: TES 18Ns, 22s, and 28s auction on 29May13 was extremely weak, about 10bp below the market levels.
            This triggered the big selloff in rates. Next TES auction, 18Ns/22s/28s, is on 12Jun13.

            ****Chile****

            Rates: Chile continues to outperform other LatAm rates by selling off barely 10bp this week. Camara swaps
            are leading the selloff widening the tight swap spreads. Even after pricing in 50bp cuts, Chile looks rich
            vs USTs, but the correction may not happen before the cut (if happens) materializes. We would be looking for
            better entry points for spread wideners in Chile (vs USTs)

            Curves: As mentioned before, Chile curve is very flat both fundamentally and technically. There was very
            slight steepening during the selloff last week. But the curve steepened significantly yesterday after the
            BCCh minutes came out, which mentioned the consideration of 25bp cut at the CB meeting. It was a bull
            steepening, led by the extreme short end. Curve still has a lot of room to steepen, especially the long end.

            Rich/Cheap: We still prefer going underweight the long end BTP 43s and 32s vs the short end, BTPs may
            outperform BCPs due to GDNs but that will be insignificant vs any curve move.

            Priced in: Camara curve is pricing more than 60bp cut this year for Chile, up by 10bp since last week.
            Likelihood of cuts is much higher in August meeting than in July meeting. Citi is calling for 50bp in cuts
            for the year.

            Citi Portfolio: We have 1s5s Camara steepener in Chile and we are underweight duration in the bond
            portfolio.

            Auction: 10y BTP auction on 29May13 was strong with 2.3 bid/cover. Next BTP 20y and 30y auction is on
            5Jun13, given the big surprise in the recent TES auction, we will be extremely careful with long end
            auctions in LatAm rates, especially which are lagging USTs. Although in case of Chile the dovish BCCh mins
            should mitigate some of that risk.

            ****Peru****

            Rates: Overstretched weakening ins FX is now spilling over to rates. Just like TES, Peru rates sold off more
            than 50bp last week, and yields caught up with current levels of USTs. Sell off in Peruvian rates post NFP
            is now in line with other LatAm countries. Given how sold off FX is, further underperformance in rates in
            USTs selloff cannot be ruled out.

            Curves: As mentioned before, Peru is one of the steeper curves in LatAm. High foreign ownership may lead to
            continued steepening with UST selloffs. Trend in steepening has been steady but any panic selloffs have
            usually hurt short end more than the long end. We will look for opportunities in flatteners with net short
            duration, as we believe the curve will lose sensitivity to selloffs at some point, improving the
            risk/rewards for flatteners.

            Citi Portfolio: We have duration neutral barbell position, short 26s vs 23s and 31s, in our portfolio

            Rich/Cheap: 31s have been continuously underperforming the curve and pushing their cheapness to new
            historical lows; mostly on the back of outperformance of 23s/26s. We would chose 23s and 26s for cutting any
            duration in Peru.

            Priced in: Citi is calling for 50bps in cuts this year

            Venz/PDVSA : Now lower on the day, after being up around 1.75pts on the day earlier this morning. As an
            example, Ven 27s were trading at 91 earlier, now 89 offered.. The move higher was met with sellers and
            street does not feel very confident stepping in and buying paper just yet. Longer duration bonds getting hit
            a bit more. The move has been in very little volumes, both on the flow side and on the interdealer side.
            Liquidity very poor still.....

            Argentina : Starting to suffer a bit also. It has held in very well over the past week, but starting to feel
            a little heavy now, with some sellers out there in arg pars, discounts, and local law paper... However still
            very illiquid and small flows.

            CHILE FX. Open 498.5, Close 500.40, Hi 501.3, Lo 498.5. Vol 1491 (spot). Very mixed flows here: RM, MODELS
            +USD, HF -USD. The market continues to be net LONG CLP and generally the HFs selling look like most
            close-outs of short term long USD positions. We still see 495-505 trading range and prefer to buy USD in the
            lower end of the range. We have IMACEC out tomorrow and CPI on Friday.
            Forwards points remain elevated (fix @ 2.45), but longer end (1y) points we see better USD sellers and find
            paying the 1y vs rolling 1m attractive (i.e. sell 1y basis @ 20).

            CLP VOL: Big move lower in RR+ATM after explosive moves higher over the last week, especially in the short
            end (to 6m). Today we covered some of the 2m and 3m vega that we had been paid for over the week by clients.

            COLOMBIA FX. Open 1902, Close 1894, Hi 1905, Lo 1891.66 USD quickly went offered this morning after Monday&apos;s
            holiday. Remember the CB came out with an approx 31mm /USD day intervention program after the close on
            Friday (2.5 bio USD June-Sep) which was expected by the majority of market participants (some thought no
            program, and a few thought the Cardenas program of 9.5 bio to Dec 31). We think the pension fund reform will
            have a much larger impact (2nd draft can be released any day) and will push spot to 1950.

            IBR was better offered today on offshore receiving interest in 1y and 2y IBR. The rest of the curve looked
            offered but closed almost unchanged. Net-net very little volume went through interbank today (80 bio 1y, 10
            bio 2y, 35 bio 3y). The x-ccy swaps were better bid, squeezing the basis.

            Finally, a pretty good session for Mex rates as since the opening we had some Asian accounts turning around
            and adding some risk in Mbonos, while we had some RM even before the opening looking to build some risk in
            long end Mbonos across the curve. With this, we saw some dealers that were on the sidelines also jumping in
            to receive rates and we had a nice rally closing some 12bps lower on 10Y TIIE IRS, while Mbonos closed some
            15-17bps tighter on the belly and long end of the curve, finally over-performing TIIE.

            Today we had consumer confidence in Mexico coming in line with expectations at 95.2 vs. 95.50 expected.
            Later on the day we had Banxico auctioning 3Y Mbono, which came on lower b/c that we were expecting at 4.35%
            with b/c of only 2.79, tad below our expectations of last auction at 2.98. 3Y Udibono come at 0.90% with b/c
            of 2.07, also below our expectations from last auction of 2.52 and 1Y average of 2.33. Finally, we had Cetes
            coming at 3.71%, 3.76% and 3.86% for 1, 3 and 6M Cetes, respectively, with 3s and 6s, 1bps below last
            auction.

            Subject: Updated Macroeconomic Forecast Grid

            We did not revise our real GDP forecasts in the wake of this morning&apos;s data. Rather this updated
            Macroeconomic Forecast Grid reflects the second downward revision to real GDP growth we made last Friday,
            after benchmark revisions to the retail sales data suggested much weaker spending in the month than
            previously reported (the revised retail sales figures for April showed that the control group -- i.e. sales
            excluding auto dealers, building materials, and gasoline stations, which are incorporated directly into the
            BEA&apos;s estimates of PCE -- were cut back sharply). Thus, we now look for real PCE to rise just 1.6%
            annualized in Q2 vs. a 3.4% gain in Q1. As a result, we lowered our Q2 real GDP growth estimate to just 1.3%
            annualized. An important note: much of the swing in the consumer spending pace between Q1 and Q2 is due to
            utilities (heating bills were high in Q1, but that impetus is now reversing). In fact, as the chart below
            illustrates, spending excluding household utilities has been advancing at roughly the same clip all year.
